Chuy Zarate\n\nFeel like your scenework is stagnating? Do you find yourself resting on what you know works in front of an audience for self-gratification? Do you get too far into your head when you are trying to build a simple scene? Too many times improvisers feel the need to be clever or witty on stage.\n\nDo you get stuck in a whirlwind of bits that really serve no purpose in a scene? It might be time to forget what you know and remember that there are simple building blocks to scene work. There is no better way to get out of your head and back into the scene than remembering the basics. We will wipe the slate clean.\n\nTo be successful at the long scene, you need to be proficient in the short scene. By the end of this workshop, you should have a strong instinct for creating quick relationships and lasting scene premises. You will look at scene starts as the most important aspect of every scene. Your relationship establishing \"muscle memory\" will hopefully take over and guide you to satisfying and creative scenes.\n\nIf you're still working on improv basics, stick with it!  But since this is a \"BACK to basics\" class, improvisers with a year or more of improv experience will be most comfortable in this class.\n______________\nEstevan J. Chuy Zarate is an actor/director/coach from San Antonio TX that has been improvising for audiences for 29 years. He is a member of The Big Bash at Hideout Theatre, The Known Wizards (Merlin Works faculty team), Zarzamora and more duos than he can count. He teaches all styles and formats being that he has a very eclectic tool belt to reach into. If there is a scenario to be performed in, he has probably performed it. With specialties in improv singing and grounded/character-driven scenework, Chuy has coached hundreds of kids, teens, students and adults for years to multiple successes.", "end_time": "2019-08-17T16:00:00-0500", "place": {"name": "Bexar Stage", "location": {"city": "San Antonio", "country": "United States", "latitude": 29.43989, "longitude": -98.48344, "state": "TX", "street": "1203 Camden St.", "zip": "78215"}, "id": "981998285193480"}, "type": "public", "start_time": "2019-08-17T13:00:00-0500", "id": "745834102525962"}, {"ticket_uri": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cheap-date-grumpy-old-men-wkisses-fists-bachelors-of-science-improvcomedy-tickets-68772040023", "name": "Cheap Date: Grumpy Old Men, Kisses & Fists, Bachelors Of Science", "description": "Spend Friday nights with someone you love (or like, we don't judge) at Bexar Stage variety showcase, Cheap Date!\n\nGrumpy Old Men Improv relives the past, proving that passing your prime is only a mistake in a grocery store. \n(Brian Scribner, Dave Vann, Phil Bernhardt)\n\nKisses & Fists - This all-woman group is a rollercoaster of fun as they build tension and create laughter through object work and character choices.\n(Channing Winchell, Cristal H, Crystal Jackson, Lindsey Nave, Lynn Thomas)\n\nBachelors Of Science - Remember that crazy professor you once had?
