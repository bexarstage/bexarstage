This is about long-form improv, the practice of making up funny scenes as you go, on a stage

 My name is Will Hines, an improviser at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre who ran classes in NYC from 2009-2013

 Now I teach and perform in Los Angeles

 This blog contains memories, thoughts, opinions about long-form improv

 It will be unapologetically insidery, shamelessly indulgent and often completely wrong

A metaphor for playing it real



 

Okay, so think about an improv scene like a ping pong table

 In ping pong, you are required to hit the table on each volley

 If you don’t, you lose a point

 You ALSO generally want to hit the ball as fast as you can so it’s hard to return

 But you can’t hit it so hard that it doesn’t come down and bounce off the table



In a scene, you want interesting, fun, even crazy things to happen

 You want to “say yes” to the thing that might not happen on a regular day

 But you still have to hit the table on every move



 

“Not hitting the table” means not playing it real, which means you’re doing something that feels false and weird and forced



EXAMPLES TAKE SO LONG TO EXPLAIN BUT HERE’S ONE ANYWAY

So let’s say you’re a cop and you’ve pulled someone over for a speeding ticket, and the person asks you to get in the car for a ride



If you just say “Sure!” with no justification and no regard for how weird that question is — then you didn’t hit the table

 Sure, you “said yes” but you just hit it back as hard as you could and it seems false and weird



Better to do one of these:

You just say “no, sir, I’m not getting into your car

” – that is realistic

 That’s hitting the table

 Younger students may feel like this is wrong – but think of it instead as just a slow return

 It’s okay and even essential for your characters to say “no” without guilt

 If it turns out you need to get in that car, you can change your mind a bit later in the scene

 But for now: you preserved the integrity of the scene

 You hit the table, so the volley can continue



Another option: maybe you’re quick enough that you can say yes and you also provide a reason why

 You say “Well, I don’t normally do this, but I’m really mad at my boss

” or “I guess this is my one chance to ride in a Lamborghini

” You hit the table and you gave a very fast return



OR – maybe you’re a good enough actor that you can say yes with a sense of gravity and mischief

 Without even explaining it, the audience can feel that your policeman has made some internal decision

 The driver says “Wanna get in?” and the policeman takes a beat, lets the question soak in, looks over his shoulder to see if anyone is watching, then says “Yes

” I would count THAT as hitting the table too



I see newer improvisers who say no to everything in order to keep it real, and they don’t seem to develop the skills necessary to “hit it back faster” (make fun stuff happen)

 And I see people who make fun stuff happen with no regard for reality



My point here is that ideally you have to hit the table pretty much every time, and also have the skills to – not every time, but at opportune times –  hit the ball fast

 When in doubt, hit the table

 But also look for ways to hit it back with some speed



 

That works, right? This is a good one! FULL DISCLOSURE RIGHT AT THE TOP: I is a white dude from New England whose family had enough cash to send him to college

 Got it? Okay



EDITED TO ADD: The most interesting answer would come from getting all female performers from the UCB in a room —- no men allowed — and ask them

 That would be interesting

 I would want to hear the answer



Okay, onto this long ramble



WORTH TALKING ABOUT

“Women vs

 men” stuff is always interesting, though also always fraught with personal bias, anecdotal evidence and kneejerk reactions

 That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be talked about

 It should be discussed without apology

 But if you want to have a productive discussion that will change things, it is best approached in a calm, non-scolding manner

 I like the tone of your question, for example

 It feels curious and honest without being accusatory — which is the most helpful posture



The way to talk about it without sounding like a jerk is to just take a breath and do it as honestly as you can

 And be cool when people get a bit huffy

 People get huffy

 Just stay cool and nod your head that you understand and hope that your calmness calms them down



 

Try to have empathy that no one gets up in the morning and says “Today I will be biased

” Artists like good art, and the people who put house teams together want good teams above all

 That is for real true

 But bias does happen anyway! It’s mysterious how it happens



Honesty, empathy, patience and experimentation are the answer, somehow



WARNING: STATISTICS AHEAD

In December of 2011, while I was running the school at UCB in NYC I was talking with then Artistic Director Nate Dern about male-female ratios

 He asked what the ratios were in the classes, and I was stunned to realize I had no idea



So, Erik Tanouye and I started looking at male-female ratios in the classes

 It was tough because we hadn’t been recording people’s gender

 So I had an intern go over 6 months worth of improv classes (first 6 months of 2011) and GUESS the gender of the students based on name

 I know

 Not a great system

 I also got some teachers to indicate some of the names we weren’t sure about

 Some teachers didn’t want to do it, others were just disorganized and never got around to it

 Hardly an exact science, but it was a start

 We got numbers on about 2000 registrations



What we found in was that for that 6 month period — the male/female ratio was about 1 man for every 1 woman in level 1, and it steadily became more men until it was about 1

3 men for every 1 woman in level 4

 Not even as bad as I had feared



BUT: You had to be approved to get to level 5

 And what we found was that in level 5 the ratio was 2

2 MEN FOR EVERY ONE WOMAN in the advanced level

 More than two to one!

WHOA

 I was stunned

 Were we approving men at a higher rate than women? We checked that — and no

 We were approving just about the same percentage of men as we were women

 There were slightly more men than women to pick from, but there was no reason that we shouldn’t at least have the same ratio in level 5 as we did in level 4



Women were just way less interested in level 5 than the men

 I had no idea why



I also looked for the first time at the gender ratios of the teachers and discovered to my horror that in two years I had only ever assigned one female teacher to teach the level two classes — 44 of the 47 level 2 sessions had been taught by men

 What disturbed me was I didn’t even realize that

 It wasn’t a conscious decision

 But it had happened! Weird



I reported this all to the teachers, and everyone immediately had guesses as to why all this was

 But they were just guesses



 

COLBY INITIATIVE

So we started something called the Colby Initiative (named by Shannon O’Neill after the Amy Poehler character on the UCB Show)

 Our mission: increase the number of women in level 5 improv classes

 More informally: would Amy Poehler have taken level 5 at our school? 

I liked it because it was specific and measurable



We threw a lot of things against the wall: Shannon started the Lady Jam and started teaching free workshops for female improvisers

 We told the level 4 teachers to specifically recommend level 5 for the strong female improvisers

 I promoted more female teachers into higher levels, gave more classes to existing female teachers, and hired female teachers first



We all had different opinions on which of these things mattered

 But rather than argue about it, we tried whatever we could

 Find it on its feet, like good improvisers do



People who worked on the Colby Initiative got a little money for their time and we got teachers working on it in their spare time

 Chelsea Clarke led a group of teachers in calling female students who were given the highest rating from their level 4 teachers but who never took another class

 Chelsea and others called them and basically asked “why did you never take another class?”

(They didn’t ask that directly

 They just took a general survey of their experience at the school

 We didn’t say “we are trying to figure out why women are less interested in level 5

” But in the general survey we asked why they had started taking classes, and if they planned on taking more

)

WHY DID YOU STOP TAKING CLASSES?

I wish I could give you a hard answer here

 But we’re not experts in data analysis or methodology

 And there was no one single overpowering answer

 These people in general had really good things to say about their experience at UCB, but they also said they felt they were done

 Common things said: classes were too expensive, the good teachers’ classes sold out too frustratingly fast and that they had gotten what they wanted out of UCB classes and were trying other things



What we suspected —- and it was just a suspicion — was that they didn’t think they had enough of a chance to get on a UCB house team to make it worth the time/money/trouble of taking more classes unless it was a great teacher



Maybe it was just a vicious cycle: more men on the stage makes the men in the classes try harder makes for more men on stage? That is just a guess



I will say that one year later the ratio of men to women had evened a bit to be 1

5 men for every woman

 Better, at least

 Moving in the right direction



What I was most happy about was that we tried stuff

 You can theorize all day (and post rants, and re-tumblr things that make you and others outraged), but in the end the only way to really learn anything is to try it

 There was also no finger-pointing within the ranks

 It wasn’t like “you did X wrong” and instead it was like “what if we tried X?” Our years of performing together gave us respect for each other, and we focused on results rather than arguing



LIKE BEGETS LIKE

My personal feeling is that LIKE BEGETS LIKE

 If you want more women in the classes, get more talented women on stage

 People take classes if they identify with the people on stage

 Gender and race are powerful factors when people relate to each other



 

Though of course they’re not the only ones

 Comedy nerds like other comedy nerds regardless of gender or race, of course



 

But it comes down to this: If you feel like you belong on the stage, you’ll take the classes and stick with it



I think that demographics and diversity is something worth worrying about and trying to consciously improve

 I also think that you have to be sensitive to the fact that communities form organically and that you CAN’T really meddle beyond a certain degree

 You can nudge and push but there has to be a natural momentum which you are accelerating

 You try stuff and then try to figure: is that working? It’s like an improv scene — you know it when you feel it if it’s working



 

As far as your question about wondering if you have to be pretty to get on a team: I think there IS a bias towards attractive people but I think it’s there for both men and women

 Especially if you look at percentages

 There is a much higher percentage of attractive male improvisers on the stage than in the community in general! That’s just my impression

 I see attractive men and women doing better than their less attractive counterparts in ALL AREAS OF LIFE UGH



 

POSTSCRIPT: added April 23, 2015

 I’ve gotten a few messages asking why we didn’t devote the same energy to other diversity issues, like for example black improvisers, gay improvisers

 Two part answer

 Part One: we do have the diversity program which has scholarships and workshops and jams and stuff

 So we were/are worrying about that

 But I recognize that doesn’t seem like the same level of intensity as the Colby initiative

 That’s because of Part Two: note that we had fifty-fifty male/female in level one and LOST the women after level four

 Trying to hold onto a group of people who started but left seemed like something that was CLOSE

 Like a solvable doable thing

 So we bore down on it

 Figuring maybe we could learn something about the weird world of trying to change demographics in the process

 Also, we’re idiots who are just trying stuff as we go

 One of the most common categories of questions I get at my improv blog is the “I’m playing with someone bad

 What do I do?”

Examples:

“Will, I get to play on an awesome Harold team, but there is at 1 player who seems to ask the audience what is funny in shows

 They don’t really ever present the swagger you mention

 The worst part is that they cause a domino effect and bring other players into that insecure zone

 How do you get around that/push through it?”

“I have a friend who is a great person but an absolute stage hog

 It just brings down the show or jam group that she’s a part of

 Should I be the one to tell her this or should I just let her find out on her own?”

“Hi Will- I’ve been struggling with this question internally for a while, and I’d like to get your perspective on it

 I recently started practicing with a group that does mostly organic improv

 The issue I am having is that one individual interjects himself into every scene, mostly before a game is even established

 How can I make him aware that this behavior is detrimental to the group without insulting him? Is the solution to just practice with another group?”

“I’m a beginning improviser at university, and my uni has an improv team that has some problems

 The guy who runs it resists any suggestions from anyone, isn’t good about encouraging improvement on any level, has been doing this for years, etc

 The team also has a lot of cheap, gimmicky habits (imo, I guess)

 But the team performs

 A lot

 Is it better to play with them and get performance experience or stay away because I just wish it was a better environment? Thanks

”

“I recently formed a practice group with a group of great improvisers

 However, the coach they’ve selected - and adore - is not to my liking whatsoever

 While I find this person to be a great performer, I find their coaching style low energy and extremely negative (the criticism is not constructive), and our fundamental views on improv are very different

 Do you have any advice on how to navigate this situation?”

“How do I tell my team mates I think we had a bad show? I try just talking about the things I do that are bad (not listening, bailing on choices, etc

) but then that lets everyone else off the hook

 No one else is open to talk about the shows that bomb

 Is that how it should be? Should I just keep my mouth shut and hope that everyone gets better on their own?”

Variations include that so and so is sticking out amongst the group, or maybe is behind everyone else, or playing really broadly, or mugging at the audience, or is somehow hurting otherwise good scenes

 Many varieties of “when am I allowed to tell this person they’re bad” or “what do i do if I’m stuck with someone who’s bad?”

A qualification: I’m not talking about people who are being jerks as human beings, like people who mistreat you or are mean

 Or someone who does something straight-up inappropriate on stage, like puts you or someone in a sexual situation or who criticizes the actual humans around him/her onstage

 You can and should walk away from people who are mean to you or make you feel bad

 If it’s in class, make sure the teacher noticed or if it’s a jam, tell the host



 

I’m talking about people that you think are improvisers with bad comedic or acting taste and for whatever reason you’re about to do a scene or show or class with them



You Go To Them
Without knowing the specific situation, here is my first instinct every time that question is asked: YOU GO TO THEM

 You stop questioning what’s wrong with the other person and you focus on what you are doing

 You say “yes and” and get on that page and play

 If they won’t budge, you go to them and you don’t even hesitate

 Don’t even think about what might be wrong them, you just play



You are thinking: “No, you haven’t seen this person

” Not that person, no

 But I have played with every kind of player, often for YEARS

 And if you’re asking me how to play with that person the answer is: YOU GO TO THEM

 If they are literally denying their own reality each and every line, then yes-and the last thing said and change with them if need be

 No excuses

 This is the answer, and the sooner you learn it the sooner this will be fun



You’re thinking “Well, no, this person just needs to fix like one thing – can I say it?” Especially if you are new to this – and I’m counting new in the “less than 3 years” kinda new – then you don’t really know enough

 Even if you said something and the person was able to correct it, it might not have the effect you want

 There might be some good behind what they’re doing

 The better solution is for you to adjust YOUR play, because you can control that

 You know what you feel like, so keep trying different things until you enjoy the scenes



You can still be yourself

 If they are broad, then be your version of broad

 If they are crazy, justify it in a way that keeps the fun of that crazy

 If they are quiet and take a while to talk, then chill out

 If they refuse to make eye contact, then go without eye contact

 If like to make things really unusual right away, just yes-and it towards something that interests you which is what you are supposed to be doing

 Assume there is a way to do it and do it

 You can do it

 You don’t need them to change, you can connect with them whatever they do

 That is your job



Doug Moe, a UCBT improviser, talks about bringing this up to Kevin Dorff, a former Second City mainstage player and long-time writer for Conan O’Brien

 “His advice was don’t worry about ‘the guy

’  He said, you’ll get rid of ‘the guy’ and there’ll be a new ‘the guy

’”

Would you rather be right or be in a great scene?

The performers MUST connect and meet else the scene does not exist

 Agreement before all else

 In fairness they should meet halfway, but if you find yourself in a scene with people who won’t budge, then for the sake of the scene you go all the way to them



In the second improv workshop I ever took in a black box theater on Ludlow St

 in Manhattan in 1998, I did a scene with a guy who was, I can say in fairness, a terrible improviser

 He contradicted facts I said, he mugged for the audience

 He interrupted me and talked about sex nonstop

 Problem: the audience (rest of the class) loved him

 They cracked up at everything he did, laughing at his outrageousness

 I sat stewing, knowing that I was doing it “right” and was getting no attention for it

 I was brand new and could not get my thoughts together while playing with this jerk



At the break I said to a friend of mine “That guy is so annoying” and my friend, who was grinning from ear to ear, shrugged his shoulders — “it’s hilarious

”

And he didn’t mean that my frustrating predicament was hilarious

 He meant this guy’s outrageousness was enjoyable, and that my friend had not been paying attention to my artistic pain because who gives a shit?

And I realized I had to choose: did I want to be right, or would I prefer to be part of a fun scene?

I wish I had just said yes and made it work

 That I had agreed that I was here to see the doctor for “dick pills

” That my name was “Roger Roger Roger

” That I was bribing him to tell my ex-wife that I was no longer on heroin

 That I was “super gay

” That even though I got flustered, that I amped up the fluster, so the audience could enjoy that more since they already were

 I still think about it all the time

 He was wrong, but by not playing, I was also wrong



True, I didn’t have to be on a team with him or even see him after that workshop

 Still, my job is to make the scene work

 To play it as it is, not as I think it should be



You’re probably thinking: I can’t do that

 This person is no good in any way and anything I do he/she will wreck

 Maybe

 I advise you at least to think of it in these terms: “I don’t yet know how to make that good

”

More: I asked someone who was on a great team if they ever sat down and had a big honest talk about what kind of improv they wanted to do

 And this person said to me “We would never give each other notes, and even if we did, no one would take them

” And that illuminated it for me

 You can’t worry about what the other person SHOULD do, because you don’t know for sure, and you can’t control it

 You have to worry about your side of the street

 Say yes

 Add to it

 You go to them

 You make it work



Even more: In some future group, you will worry that YOU are this person which everyone else dreads

 At that time, you will be happy if you have discouraged the part of your brain that judges others so that it won’t be so powerful when it turns in on you

 I’ve done it to myself — judging harshly — it takes a lot of effort to undo



Wait, So How Can I Tell If Someone Is Being A Jerk?
Once again, if they are treating you badly as a person – either on-stage or off – then you don’t have to put up with it

 But if just don’t like their style, then you owe it your future self as an unbeatable improviser to yes-and those moves



You’re Not Getting It

 I Have To Tell Someone


Tell your coach

 If you don’t have a coach, leave the group and form a new one

 Or form a second group and play with both and see if that solves the problem

 If this is the third time you’ve done this, read this whole essay again



What If My Team Sat Around And Gave Each Other Notes? You Know, Just To Clear The Air?
Nope

 You’re trying to direct the team, not play on it



If you really need to get something off your chest, then go right to the person and be candid but polite, one-on-one

 Trust them with your honest opinion, but do them the courtesy of having specific examples, worded in terms of how your felt, not what you think they should be doing

 So don’t say “you shouldn’t walk on so much’ or “you make things crazy too fast” but you can say “When you walked on to my scene in practice last week and endowed me as a member of a rap crew, it threw me off

”

Many people frustrated with a teammate will go to a THIRD teammate and ask in confidence if he/she shares the opinion

 “Am I crazy? Person X is bad, right?”  If this helps to let go of your bad feeling, then do it

 But don’t make a habit of bitching behind people’s back, it can be a bad habit

 Also, we all have a knack of picking as our confidant someone that we believe will agree with us anyway



Learn to play with this person and if you just can’t do it, make plans to get to a new group



Wait, But, I Actually Really Like This Person But They Just Do This One Thing, Could I Give Them The One Note?
Eyes on your own paper



No

 I Have Been On My Team For Years and I Know How This Team Works And I Need To Say Something About The Kind Of Play This Person Is Doing


Okay

 If you have been doing improv for, I don’t know, more than three years, minimum? And if you have been on that particular ensemble for at least three years and you are among the most senior people on that team, then, yes, you have a right to speak to the overall tone of the team

 Meaning if you are a veteran in general and also a veteran on that ensemble

 Here’s my advice on that:

Say you want a team meeting in a BRIEF email because you need to discuss issues with shows

 The meeting should be after a show when you were all going to be together

 Everyone stands since that’s a guaranteed way to keep the meeting short

 Speak your piece in a general way and then give a specific example

 "I think we’ve been going too crazy too fast and I want the shows to be slower, like last week when we were all fucking blow job machines in the first ten minutes – I just want to not do that

“ The more specific the better: “I don’t like when we initiate scenes with fights

 All I want to do is not fight and every initiation picks a fight

 Last week I walked out and when Bob said ‘Get the fuck out of my office’ I couldn’t even think

” Or “I feel we’re going for home runs every time we open our mouths and I want to go for base hits

 Don’t make me a Nazi before I even say what I’m doing

” Or “I feel people get tagged out after one line every show

” Or “Could we do a show where I don’t get picked up and carried around the stage?” Bring up a show that did what you want

 “The one where we were all at desks, and then we ended up roller blading together – that one felt right

”

What will probably happen is people will discuss if they see it the same way or not

 They’ll bring up times that the behavior you don’t like actually helped

 They’ll point out how in the show you liked there was some of that behavior you said you didn’t like, or that it was BECAUSE of that show that things happened in other shows you didn’t like



And then you’ll all settle on some rule: “No tag outs for the first half of the show

” Or “No going meta in the opening

” Something that’s simple so it doesn’t restrict people too much and something that’s easy to follow so there’s no argument over whether it was followed or not

 People will generally be cool with that in the name of the team being smoother



My brother and I do two prov and although we weren’t irritated with each other we did settle on one rule: “No fighting in the first line of the show

”  Sometimes we break even that easy-to-follow rule and after the show we’ll say “we fought in the first line” and the other person will say “Oh right, right

 Yes, we shouldn’t do that

” and then next time we won’t

 My brother and I have been doing improv for more than ten years



In my first three years of doing improv, we had team meetings every few months

 They rarely helped

 I think we just didn’t know enough about improv in general or our own improv preferences to really talk about them

 Then they started happening once every two years

 Those were helpful

 Phrases for Describing The Game Of The Scene
You’ve got a funny idea

 Are you able to explain it? Or maybe a scene was actually funny, thank god, but can you describe what the funny part was? You’ve got to do better than just saying “the part where everyone screamed” or “the way Bert did the thing

”

Try these helpful phrases to accurately describe what made it funny:

WHAT IF: Title the game with a “What If” – “what if the top clique at a high school were scientists?” (via Fernie via Matt Walsh)

 That makes you isolate the main funny part



INSTEAD OF: Say “instead of” to clarify: “So, a version of the show Cops but instead of domestic violence and drug deals they bust people who play sex games

”  This forces you to say the “normal” version which makes the “funny” part pop



AS IF: “A guy who tries to wow his date with a fried egg as if it were caviar / champagne

” This is direction for the actors/performers (even if the actors/performers are YOU); this gives an example of how to play the funny part



That’s good

 Right? I mean, there’s probably others but don’t get nuts this is good


You Already Know The Real “Why”
In improv, you always need a good “why

” 

The trick is realizing that you often already know why, deep down, even when the things you’re doing happened instinctually

 Don’t fix it to what you think the why SHOULD be



Like you’re doing a two person scene and the other person says “I want to run with the bulls in Spain” and you have a gut reaction that makes you shake your head with a little bit of disgust and you say “Ugh, not that

”

You didn’t sit there and plan that out

 You’re not in your head, you’re just reacting — which is good — but NOW you need to decide why you just did that



The teacher stops the scene and asks you “I see you don’t like that idea, why not?”

And you feel guilty at first that you “said no,” so you hurriedly correct yourself: “I mean, I LOVE RUNNING WITH THE BULLS

”

And the teacher says “No, I didn’t want you to change your mind

 It’s okay you didn’t like it

 I just wanted to know why your character didn’t like it

”

And you think back and try to think of a logical explanation and glom it onto to the scene

 “Maybe his father was killed by bulls?” 

“No, ” says the teacher

 “That’s not what they reason was

 You HAD a reason — there’s something you didn’t like about the idea on a gut level, I’m just asking what that reason was

 The one you already had

”

And you remember what it felt like when you had that reaction and realize the honest answer is something like “Because that’s something douchey frat jerks do?” or “Ugh, that’s what EVERYONE wants, let’s do something different” or “You’re just trying to show off, don’t be a jerk

”

That’s it

 That’s the real reason

 The one the audience could sense and the one they will laugh at when they see you able to realize it and articulate it



I think when you have an instinctual visceral reaction to something — it’s probably the honest and true one

 You have to be able to just say what you’re honest reaction is



Being able to stop, hold and articulate your natural feelings is a hugely necessary skill in improv

 There are many people out there who can’t do that

 The moment you make them think about what they’re saying or feeling and ask them why —- all their awareness vanishes

 Can you imagine your co-worker, after they say something like how they “hate French Vanilla coffee” being asked “why?” They’d look at you and just say “what do you mean WHY? I just DO

” 

Not enough in improv

 You must be an honest reporter of your natural unaffected feelings

 Tricky

 But it’s way more important than doing a great accent, or being able to think of 20 movies from the forties, or even being able to emote a huge range of feeling



Don’t think about it, don’t fix it — just say what you felt


Without a good teacher monitoring, most improv exercises favor bold, aggressive students

 Whoever either thinks faster or at least acts fastest tends to affect the scenes more and therefore have more chances for feeling validated that they are doing well

 While there’s a place for boldness (and certain exercises explicitly focus on being more bold), any good improv team has a mixture of aggressive types with more patient and calm energies



Believing that, here are five simple rules of conduct which I think help the less aggressive students find their footing in lower level improv classes

 These are also just common sense policies for fair play

 They’re not meant to leave out aggressive students

 And I never state them as being “for the students who are bit more hesitant

” They’re just good etiquette for improv scenes which happen to also help the non-alphas find themselves in the scene



Merely my opinion: Take ‘em or leave ‘em, fellow teachers!

Initiation Etiquette /  ”Be Comfortable With Silence”

 Students should not interrupt  or finish someone else’s initiation: very commonly done by eager alpha bulldogs in lower levels

 Teach that whoever moves first gets focus and a generous amount of time to make their move

 The person who responds also gets a lot of time before they have to answer

 Discourage the very common practice of talking until you are interrupted

 “Be comfortable with silence” I will say a lot



It’s Okay To Not Know Cultural References

 After the first scene in class that happens to mention a movie/book/song/TV show — I point out that they’re not expected to know every movie, book or current event that gets brought up

 They SHOULD try to fake it based on context or else admit in character that they don’t know it

 And if they are the one who is bringing up a reference and their scene partner doesn’t know it, then it’s their job to help

 This affects younger students’ confidence far more than I had appreciated — teach them how this works

 (The other side of this coin is that after you’ve taught them how to handle references, no one is allowed to bail on a scene because they don’t know something

)

Protect Decisions To Play Against Type

 Gently point out when someone misses their scene partner’s attempt to play against type (gender, age, etc)

 It’s bad listening and invariably happens to people already feeling left out

 Correct whoever misheard as a casual note, not a lecture

 “He’s being your mother, not your father

” Or “That’s a teenager talking, not a mom

” Be vigilant for this in the first few sessions especially



Set Boundaries

 This is a class, not a team

 Students see very physical and intrusive things on stage at shows

 They need you to make clear and enforce that that’s not for class, where people don’t know each other well

 Though everyone would assume this is probably true, many will be relieved to have the teacher explicitly say it



You Are Allowed To Say No

 You are always allowed to “say no” in a scene to ANYTHING that your character wouldn’t want to do

 Like if someone starts a scene by asking if you want a lap dance or maybe wants to steal someone’s baby from a hospital nursery, and your character wouldn’t want to, you can say “no” and you’re not being a bad improviser, (best way is to add a simple truthful reason why, and then stay open to discussing it in character)

 Even if you immediately realize you are saying “no” to something out of nervousness and you wish you had said yes, it’s okay because it’s important to get practice saying “no” properly in a scene

 The take-away here is that you need to play your characters to the top of their intelligence, not trapped by what you think you “should” do because of “yes-and

” They forget this a lot so you remind them


Improv As Practical Advice
When you ask people to think of reasons why someone took an improv class for the first time you get answers like “I wanted to do something fun” or “I’m a huge comedy fan” or “I wanted to be able to think on my feet more for my job

”

(Side note: people often say “wanted to get better at public speaking” but only when they’re guessing why OTHER people might be taking improv classes

) 

Improv classes aren’t as silly as you expect

 Yes, they’re fun but they’re more like acting classes

 Many big comedy fans don’t know what long-form improv is, and they take a class because they’ve memorized the casts of SNL and see that many of them “did improv

”  They don’t know what they’re in for



I don’t really think it improves thinking on your feet

 And no one speaks publicly ever, now that we have the internet



So what practical skills DOES improv give you? These ones



1) Listening

 Deeper, fuller, more actively

 Time will slow down during conversations and you will be able to hear them more accurately

 This absolutely will happen to everyone who takes improv classes for any decent length of time



2) Brevity

 Improv rewards succinct, direct talk

 You’ll learn to do it because the audience laughs and listens to you more when you get to the point



3) Empathy

 You will more easily be able to see things from other people’s points of view

 You will be able to argue the other side of an argument better



4) Acting

 Improv is acting and writing but it’s more acting

 You become more reactive and emotive just through the sheer reps of playing make-believe in front of others



5) Clearer opinions

 You have opinions all the time but very often you don’t pay attention to them as they’re forming

 Not the big ones, but the little ones

 You see someone on the street eating an ice cream and lots of tiny versions of superiority, jealousy, gluttony will flit through your brain, and then vanish

 Improv makes you notice and then hold onto those opinions because in a scene you might need them



6) Saying yes

 You will at least consider saying yes to things and see the value in that option more often than you did before



 

7) Patterns

 Patterns are funny, and you will learn to see them early and often



8) Silliness

 You will get sillier

 You’ll walk funnier

 You’ll use dumb voices more

 You’ll make up better fake names for things



9) Knowledge

 You’ll learn more since you’ll run across so many scenes where someone mentions something you don’t know

 You’ll find out what they were saying and remember it



10) Losing

 You’ll learn the joy of losing arguments and fights



11) Bravery

 You will be more comfortable to have people see you and watch you



12) Being Present

 You’ll worry less about the future, less about story, and more about what the moment feels like and what that implies



Those are some skills you learn

 AND NOTHING ELSE


Irony: Exercises
Last entry I talked about irony as a thing to look for in order to find strong games

 It’s hard to practice something that seems as subtle as irony

 But here are two exercises that do it

 They’re very strictly structured and definitely meant to be exercises that demonstrate a point rather than be strong scenes all by themselves



And they’re meant to be simple! In each case, let’s have a case of a type of person acting the opposite way than we expect!

They are also good if students are making unusual scenes that are more just random weird things rather good solid games



EXERCISE 1: CHANGE THE SUBJECT

Two people up

 Someone initiates as a character, preferably a bit broad and definitely with a distinctive tone in their speech

 The other player matches so we have two peas in a pod

 They start with a conversation we expect them to have and then partway through change the subject to something that feels like the exact opposite of what we expect



Two fratty dudes are talking about homecoming, and then they start talking about the beauty of Keats poetry



Two Latinas are on the corner complaining about their mothers when they change the subject to get very passionate about the latest Wes Anderson movie



Two Buddhist monks begin by calming discussion meditation and then start worrying about how big their asses are getting



Go ahead and play these characters a bit more broad and silly than we might normally want, so that the tone is very palpable



Their tone should not change

 If it’s two people being Buddhist monks, and they are affecting that tone by speaking in a low, slow monotone and nodding towards each other in a humble, submissive way – they should keep doing that even after the subject changes

 Someone who doesn’t speak English shouldn’t even be able to tell the subject was changed



Another way to think of this is that the music stays the same, but the lyrics change

 If that doesn’t make sense, please ignore this paragraph



EXERCISE 2: YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

Two people in chairs

 One says “You wanted to see me, OCCUPATION?” where occupation is anything from the very general “farmer” to “head chef at the best restaurant in town

”

Then the other person has to make three EXPECTED requests and the a fourth one that is the exact opposite of what we’d expect

 So it should go like this:

Person A: You wanted to see me, farmer?
Person B: Yes, thanks

 We need to order more grain, we need to get the tractor fixed, I’d like to lay off some of the hired help for budget reasons and also, I’d like us to stop growing food



Then Person A “straight mans” it, meaning he/she tries to respond like a rational person would

 “Uh, but that’s all we do is grow food

 We’re a farm

”

Person B then has to come up with a reason why they want to do the weird thing

 But for the purposes of this exercise, it doesn’t even matter if they have a good reason

 We’re getting used to having an ironic agenda



The straight man should ask why, and then the person with the occupation should come up with a reason why

 Don’t worry about this too much

 Although there are a lot of exercises that focus on the WHY, this one is actually more about enjoying it when there’s someone behaving in the exact opposite way as we expect



It shouldn’t be random

 This wouldn’t be as good:

Person A: You wanted to see me, farmer?
Person B: Yes, thanks

 We need to order more grain, we need to get the tractor fixed, I’d like to lay off some of the hired help for budget reasons and also, I’d like a pet dolphin living in my house



That’s kinda funny, but it’s sloppy



Once you’d done a few, you can broad the occupation to be a short description of a character

 Like this:

Person A: You wanted to see me, guy going through a hostile divorce?
Person B: Yes, come in

 I’d like to make an appointment with my lawyer

 I’d also like to set up some therapy for myself

 Call me friends to see who wants to hang out with me for a drink

 And then hire a poet to write a love sonnet about my marriage



Most Important Part

Choosing the opposite of something reveals what you think the most important aspect of something is

 For the “You wanted to see me?” exercise, I saw one like this:

Person A: You wanted to see me, Stevie Wonder?
Person B: (not worrying about doing a vocal impersonation, by the way) Yes, sit down

 I’d like to have my piano cleaned for the upcoming concert, let’s call the venue to make sure everything is in order

 I’d like to hire some different session musicians to rehearse with

 And then I want to start painting



And this person was seizing on the fact that Stevie Wonder is blind

 And yes, that’ can work – it is well-known that Stevie is blind



But is that Stevie Wonder’s PRIMARY quality? Is he known PRIMARILY for being someone who is blind, in the way that, say, Louise Braille or Helen Keller was? No, he’s known primarily for being a musician



The student tried again, and did this:

Person B: Okay, have my piano cleaned

 Let’s get some studio time soon

 I’d like a new tour manager

 And then I’d like to talk to someone about getting my hands removed


Person A: But you’re a musician! You need your hands to play the piano, or anything!
Person B: Come on! People were impressed that I could be a recording star while being blind, think how impressed they’ll be when I do it without hands!

It was better

 And this isn’t meant to be a lecture on political correctness, but it’s pointing out the importance of being precise

 Or at least, that the way you make something ironic reveals what you think the most important aspect of something is


Accusations: Three Exercises
Okay! I present here for improv nerdy delight and judgment a series of exercises on handling accusations in a scene

 Each one evolved out of the previous one, and I think they’re each useful for different levels



When I say “handling accusations” I mean treating accusations like gifts rather than an excuse to fight or to prove your character “right

" 

And when I say "accusations” I mean both:

Actual accusations, like: “Hey, Jeremy, YOU were supposed to invite people to this party!”
And the related ’explain this’ statement which is less angry but still makes the other person ‘weird’: “Jeremy, I hired you to be the clown for my son’s birthday party, why are you discussing philosophy with them?”
Both of these things can bait people into either being defensive or deflecting or fighting, so it’s good to practice responding to them



(Also: great scene ideas in my examples, as always)

EXERCISE ONE: SUPER VILLAIN / MASTERMIND

Two people up

 Person A makes an accusation

 Person B deliberately acts like a super villain or mastermind in response

 Person A must then sympathetically disagree (otherwise Person A will often get too angry)



Person A: Jeremy, did you use all the conditioner?
Person B: Bwa ha ha, yes I did! Now your hair will look stringy and flawed! AND I SHALL LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL BY COMPARISON!
Person A: (sympathetically disagreeing) Look, I know that I can be arrogant about my hair but this is really going too far


PROS: Person B practices being the “bad” character while still taking full ownership of the accusation

 The sympathetic disagreement lets Person A practice giving his/her scene partner room to digest, since they are defending something they didn’t think of

 Exercise is silly and entertaining

 As an exercise, it’s clear and easy to measure if you’ve done it right



CONS: Resulting scenes are kinda dumb



EXERCISE TWO: OWN IT

Same thing, but now Person B must admit to the accusation and explain why as a “normal” person, not a super villain

 Person A still sympathetically disagrees



Person A: Jeremy, did you forget to invite anyone to this party?
Person B: I did it on purpose

 I wanted the party to fail because I’m jealous of you having friends besides me


Person A: Yes, I know I’ve been ignoring you but you’re acting like a child!
PROS: As an exercise, it’s still easy to follow

 It makes Person B use the accusation as a way of learning more about his or her character

 In an improv scene, this strategy will actually work very often



CONS: Although more natural then the super villain one, this one can still feel forced and contrived and the scenes all take on a similar feel



EXERCISE THREE: THE REAL REASON

Same set up (two people up, Person A accuses) but this time Person B tries to feel why he/she would have done such a thing FOR REAL

 Like, in real life

 The only condition here is that you have to accept without argument that you REALLY have done the thing, you can’t change it so you didn’t do it, or even that you didn’t do it on purpose



For example, if Person A says “Sir, we found these knives and excessive liquids in your luggage

 Why were you sneaking these onto the plane?”

If you were doing super villain approach you might say “So that I can take over the skies!”

If you were doing the “own it” approach, you might say “Because I plan on using them to bully other passengers up there

”

I actually think both of those responses could work



But if you take a moment and try to feel why you might really have done it, I bet you’d take a moment to consider, then say something like this:

“You know, I just was hoping you wouldn’t check

 I thought I could get away with it

 I think the TSA policies are kinda dumb, and I’m not planning anything bad and I just didn’t care to follow your rules

”

PROS: The answers are rich, specific and have the ring of truth that makes improv compelling

 This is what the best improvisers often do when endowed with a strange situation

 It is the best approach in actual scenes



CONS: It’s hard to measure, from the student’s perspective, if you’ve done this right

 They don’t necessarily know what truth feels like on stage

 And since there’s so few restrictions on how you respond, many students will inadvertently deflect: (“I don’t know! Someone else must have put them there!” or “Ach, I took the wrong bag by mistake!” )

The exercise is basically just telling the students “be good actors and be interesting people” which is not the most helpful teaching exercise



 

IMPROV IS LIKE MEMENTO AND/OR SPLIT-BRAIN EXPERIMENTS

Here’s two stories I will tell to explain what it should feel like when you’re accused of something in an improv scene:

a) In the movie Memento, the main character can not form new memories and thus is constantly in situations which are a surprise to him (and since the scenes are show in reverse chronological order - the audience also does not know what came before)

 At one point, he’s being chased through a parking lot by someone shooting at him and you hear him thinking “Okay, so what’s going on here?” And he has to guess what’s going on with context clues

 He generally assumes that whatever is going on is because of something he’s done and that he meant for it to happen



That’s how the improviser should approach scenes where they’ve been accused

 They must assume it’s true and they did something to create this situation kinda just sense why they would have done such a thing



b) Split-Brain experiments

 For a few decades, if someone suffered from epileptic seizures that were so intense the person could not function, doctors might perform surgery to separate the hemispheres of their brains! It would stop the seizures, but leave the patients with a “split brain,” meaning the two halves of their brains could not communicate directly



This relates, just give me a moment



Doctors could then perform cool experiments like this: they’d cover the patient’s eye and ear on one side of his head, tell him something which then only one side of his brain would perceive



In one experiment, they made the patient cover his right eye and ear

 Then they said “Okay, get up, switch to cover your other eye and ear and go to the next room

” The man got up, switched to cover his other eye and ear and started to walk to the next room



The doctors stopped him and said “Where are you going?” And he said “To go to the bathroom

”

Because: he didn’t really know why he was going

 It was the other side of his brain that had made that decision

 But in the heat of the moment he made his best guess as to why he was doing such a thing and convinced himself that was the reason



That’s what it’s like to do improv

 You’re doing something, or you’re being told that you’re doing something and you don’t really know, at first, why

 But you have to explain it

 If you’re a good actor, and you’re in the moment you will come up with a specific, true and interesting reason

 It will be related on some level to why YOU would have done such a thing


“Improv question! Do you have any advice for if someone makes an offer you don’t agree with on a personal level (for example sexist, racist, offensive, in poor taste, etc), how to accept it and build on it and move the scene forward in a positive way supporting the improviser and keeping the fun going while also keeping integrity and not necessarily agreeing with or implying you condone/accept the nasty thing itself?”

I think this is a really interesting question so I’m going to talk forever about it

 Spoiler: My answer is that you should trust your gut and know it’s okay to not do the thing you don’t want to do



A slightly more advanced answer is: trust your gut and push back, but say WHY you don’t want to do the thing and then stay open to discussing it more, in character, for the sake of the scene



I believe “accept the offer” means “tell me what your character truly thinks of this and why,” not “you have to do this now

” 

But let’s use many examples and get into this, it’s a common and tricky thing



When people are learning improv, they are told time and time again “say yes, say yes, say yes

”

Students are also told, either directly or indirectly, to be skeptical of their first instinct in terms of things like learning how to speak your mind (as a character) in situations where you would normally not confront someone

 or learning to try things that you might not try in real life (“Let’s see what happens if you DO dance to this song,” or something)



And teachers ask you to do interesting things in your improv scenes, in general, rather than look for excuses to do boring things — even if in real life you’d normally do the boring thing

 Like “Quit stalling —- just jump out of the plane” (there are high number of “two people about to jump out of plane” scenes in beginning improv classes – and students seem unaware of how emotionally transparent that is)



So it’s confusing because you spend some time as your learn improv during which you basically don’t trust your first instinct, especially when that instinct is to say “no

”

And so —- and this is extremely common —- when you get into a situation when someone asks your character to do something you consider uncomfortabe, maybe creepy, possibly sexist, racist or in poor taste —- you seize up

 You wonder “wait, SHOULD I do this? Am I being a bad improviser if I ‘say no’ to this? Am I being boring?”

Let me say clearly: You’re definitely not being a bad improviser to ‘say no’ —- in character —- to something you don’t want to do or just don’t like or find in bad taste

 You SHOULD, in character, say no to those things

 That’s you putting your true self in the scene, and that’s essential to making your scenes unique and compelling

 Trust that instinct

 If your gut tells you something is weird or off, or just in poor taste, say no —- in character



 

A great follow-up to this, is that once you refuse to perform the action or say the thing — is to say why —- the simple truthful reason why — you don’t want to do it

 This is a chance for a real truthful moment which makes a show great



YOU CAN REFUSE THE LAP DANCE

I saw a scene in a level one improv class where a guy initiated to a girl “Honey, happy anniversary

 Time for my annual lap dance,” and he started doing a lap dance to her

 This was maybe not as gross as it sounds — the guy was trying to play this for laughs, he seemed to be mindful of not being actually physically intrusive — the other student is the only person who can really say whether that’s right, but it didn’t feel creepy to me, maybe just lame?

Side note: I’ve actually seen a fair number of “lap dances” as initiations for scenes

 People are drawn to them because, I guess, they’re forbidden, they’re physically silly, they feel funny to do? And I’ve seen it where the person receiving the lap dance immediately thinks it’s funny and gets into it, and the whole class laughs at this physically bold lap dance thing

 And I’m sure many students see that and are like “oh, great, so do I have to be into lap dances now? Am I going to have to grind up on someone or even just grind in anyway whatsoever? Ugh, I probably do

”

No, trust your gut

 Because in the example I’m citing, the female student said calmly what I think was a perfect response: “Sweetheart, I don’t know how to tell you this, but I just don’t like when you do this

 It’s really, I don’t know, like… gross?” And it was so true and calm and not angry and great —- everyone exploded with laughter

 The guy was not insulted and they had this great scene

 She said yes to the information — that it had happened before and was a regular thing — but she was changing her mind of how it was implied she felt about it (presumedly her character had let it happen before)



 

THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THINGS THAT BOTHER YOU

I think you DO become more comfortable with offensive things as you do more improv

 They don’t shock you as much

 Your boundaries get a bit looser

 And so your gut won’t say “no” as much

 So I can understand how you might think that the mark of a great improviser is being willing to do offensive and outrageous things

 But that’s not really true

 You always a have a personal boundary and improv scenes have a way of sniffing out what they are and bringing you right to them

 It is not only OKAY to say no to stuff at your personal boundary, it’s essential for the audience to believe you’re being truthful with them



 

Also, when you are starting out, it is sometime hard to know if you want to say “no” because you’re fearful or because the thing presented is in poor taste or offensive

 Don’t worry about that

 If you feel bummed or annoyed or grossed out, you can say “no” in character and decide later if that was the absolute best move



Just push back (say “no” in character), say why you don’t want to, and stay open to hear and consider the reaction



SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

Getting a bit more improv nerdy about it, let me say that there are ways to “accept the offer” in an improv sense while still not doing the thing you think is offensive

 I think this is really what you’re asking



I think the key is to not get angry, and to not outright dismiss or try to skip over the thing

 Trust your gut but speak to it, and stay open to hear the reaction



If a character is telling you to do something, say the word no and then explain why

 “I need you to shoot this dog

” Say “Uh, no

 I don’t shoot dogs

 that’s cruel

”

If someone is implying that you always do something you can say you’ve changed your mind —- just agree that you’ve done it before

 “Time to shoot the dog like we always do

” You say “You know what? I think I’ve come to realize this is cruel

 We’ve got to stop

”

Here’s a made-up example

 Let’s say someone initiates as a bully, and they’re doing (what I’m now realizing is) a standard improv “bully voice” and they say “Good news, dude: I just beat up some girls and fags

”

Actually, I think that’s funny

 It’s so insane, I’d probably match it

 But let’s say that I didn’t want to

 Maybe it feels too far, too dumb

 I think you should match the tone and energy but say what you feel

 Use the same improv bully voice they’re using (or your version of it, but use SOME voice so you’re not breaking the tone) and say “Hey man, you ever think we go too far?” That’s a pretty common improv tactic

 Agree with the music and energy of the scene, but say the things you mean



This is all for things that offend you

 If it’s purely a question of comedic taste, I think you should try to do it

 Hard to say without real examples

 But if someone for example initiates as a really dumb cartoonish chimney sweep, and they’re doing the worst musical theater version of a cockney accent, crooked elbow — and it’s just lame and dumb and you hate it, I still think you have to be YOUR version of a chimney sweep and you shouldn’t call the person out

 Be your version of it and move the scene along

 You should never really “roll your eyes” on stage —- though god knows I’ve done it literally hundreds of millions of times



 
Improv As Religion
A cult

 A philosophy

 A religion



These are the terms people use to describe improv

 The casual outsider would be amazed at how intensely some people view improv

 It’s just a way to make jokes, right? Or a some guidelines for brainstorming together in public? Well, yes, it is those things

 And to some people that’s all it is



But something in the language of our culture communicates something grander

 And so, those of us who really get into it, we automatically probe all of the advice we get for our scenes for something more



There’s the content of the advice — the practical usefulness of it —- and then there’s also the wording and tone which that advice is given in

 And I think the genius of Del Close and other great improv teachers is that they know how to give genuinely good advice in such a way that it connects with actors and writers in a deep, personal way



When Del said “say yes” — that could be seen as just practical advice for building scenes together

 Del could have just said “cooperate” but that term wouldn’t have the magic, alluring hint of something MORE that “say yes” does

 When we hear “say yes” we hear something much deeper

 We instinctually know that we’re being asked to be fundamentally open-minded, to be brave, to be adventurous



The most popular improv advice sounds like spiritual challenges

 “Follow the fear” — without even considering if that’s actually practical advice for an improvised comedy scene, you want to believe that

 You’ve been hungry to have someone tell you to follow the fear

 You find a way to make that advice true

 “Choose to know each other

” “Commit

” “Why is this day important?”

You may come to improv because you like comedy, but if you stay, it’s because all this advice challenges you in a way that you’ve been hungry for

 You want this to be a more interesting world, and you want to be a braver person, and then in a dingy improv classroom someone is saying it to you



It’s why you don’t mind not being paid (at first, and for a while), because you are learning

 You’re growing as a person, so it seems just that you pay for it

 Your shows are not a place where you give your services, but are a place where you are being taught by an audience of how to be spiritually and philosophically more bold



We believe that these improv classes are going to burn away the parts of our personality that we don’t like and leave in its place a braver, more powerful person

 There is no one more ready to flagellate than a newly excited improv student

 “Call me out on my bullshit,” they say

 “I like this teacher because they didn’t let me get away with shit

” It’s almost sado-masochistic, their desire to be corrected and fixed

 But it’s because they sense a spiritual perfection

 The wording of improv lessons baited them into it, and now they want it



At some point, ironically, you have to get cynical about this stuff to get good at it

 Even though it’s probably necessary to get starry-eyed and hypnotized by the promise of a grand philosophy for a while, you have to back off that kind of attitude to get funny

 You have to simply examine the advice for its practical value



You calm down and realize that “say yes” is really only useful in the beginning of a scene, and that once you realize the point of the scene — the game, the funny part — well, then saying yes isn’t really a priority anymore

 You realize that “follow the fear” speaks more to just a general attitude of bravery on the part of the actor, and that for the characters in the scene it’s almost completely irrelevant how brave they are being

 You realize that not every improv exercise is good

 And that your improv teachers may be good actors and writers, but are not trying to fix your life

 That an improv audition is not a referendum on you as a person

 The advice gets simpler and smaller and more practical



 

But I guarantee that if you do improv for years that you’re still coming back because you think it’s the Right Thing to Do — to pursue improv


Know, Care, Say
So i just wrote about the danger or people trying replace the famous “improv rules

” The “don’t ask questions” and “avoid teaching scenes” and “don’t be coy” type of rules

 It’s tough because the one thing the rules have on their side is that everyone remembers them forever



But here I go

 I’m going to suggest replacements for the rules

 Oh man, can you feel the electricity?

Ahem

 Okay! So: the rules aren’t quite right

 There’s too many

 They don’t work in enough cases

 If I had to replace them, I would replace them with this: 

Know It
Care About It
Say Something About It
I say this because I basically don’t follow the standard rules, or at least I don’t really think about them

 They rules say “Avoid transaction scenes

” But I love transaction scenes and they are very often funny

 The rules say “don’t ask questions” but my characters ask lots of questions and it works out fine



What I DO tell myself when I’m on stage is that I should to act like I know this world, I’m invested in it, and I’m going to speak my mind about it



KNOW

 CARE

 SAY



See, here’s what happens: improv works best if you “live life onstage” and just say what you would normally say in a situation

 Express the opinion you really have and such



 

EXCEPT we have these annoying instincts that protect us in real life but make us boring on stage

 I’m talking about: admitting when you don’t know something (which in real life is often), not getting invested in things that aren’t your business, and keeping your mouth shut about things that might get you in trouble



Smart rules for life

 Boring onstage



We want you to “say what you would say, assuming you know and care

”

Know it

 Care About It

 Say Something About It

So you “don’t ask questions” because you already know

 You should “be affected” because you care

 “Don’t be coy” but rather rather say what you’re thinking

 If you’re in a transaction scene then decide that you know the clerk and you care deeply about what you’re buying

 It doesn’t happen in real life enough, but we need it to always happen that way on stage



Is this anything? Would people remember this? It is a help? I guess we’ll see



Related but separate: I need a word for the effect that knowing, caring and saying has on a scene

 Is it “activeness” – it makes the situation more active? Present? Stakes? Importance? Interesting? Open is a word I like

 It keeps the scene open

 Vulnerable? I’m really letting these final paragraphs just kinda ramble and hurtle forth

 [edited to add: Michael Kayne suggests “engaged” sounds kinda good, maybe] [others are suggesting “invested” but I want this term to include the kind of move where someone says “the brownies will be ready in an hour” and then realizes that’s too far away and follows it up with “actually, i forgot, they’re done right now

” That kinda move

 IMPORTANCE?]
As a man with almost no commercial success, it is hard for me to answer this but I find myself with an multi-part opinion anyway so here it is:

I think a career in improv has seriously diminishing returns for stuff that translates into a paying job

 At first, it can connect you to a network of like-minded people, and help you develop your voice and your confidence

 And then after some amount of time, you’ve met the people you’re going to meet and your voice is as developed as it’s going to and you should get rid of all that time you’re spending in rehearsal and write your own stuff



But I find that life isn’t so clean as all that

 You don’t know which of your day’s activities is going to flower forth into a huge part of your life later

 When Neil started improv, he was a 20 year old University of Delaware commuting up to NYC to take classes with his friend Joe Wengert and he loved it for its own sake

 It clicked with him and he followed the joy and love he felt for it

 He met friends he liked (including me) and was happy spending his days doing it

 I highly doubt he was directly motivated by the idea of a possible writing job, except in an abstract “maybe someday” sense

 He was motivated by the idea of doing a better Harold, a better sketch show THAT DAY



I think Neil DID —- I mean, I’m really kind of guessing — it sounds like you should ask him

 Maybe I will ask him

 But anyway at some point Neil did decide he was not spending enough time on his own career

 He walked over to my desk in October of 2010 and proposed we write a sketch show, which we did

 This spring, he talked to friends about getting representation, which he got

 He started submitting to shows via his friends



But road to nowhere? Neil wouldn’t have been able to get representation without years of being awesome in front of hundreds of people

 Directing sketch shows for years, impressing dozens and dozens of the best writers and actors with his acumen



 

What got him his break? He didn’t have a Harvard Lampoon background, or a starring role in a Groundlings show or a part on the Second City main stage

 He had a decade’s worth of friends at the UCB Theatre in NY, at a time when that theatre coincidentally was becoming more and more nationally prominent, who unanimously pointed at him and said “he’s good

”

It was partly improv, but it was more an adult life spent following his nature and not worrying about how far up the mountain he was



When he was 20, riding up from Delaware, SNL was not on his mind

 He was thinking “I hope I have fun in this 11pm Owen Burke improv class show in which I dress up like a superhero for an hour

”

When he was 27 and he agreed to direct Stone Cold Fox (a house sketch team at UCBT) he wasn’t thinking “I bet a number of these people will work for SNL someday,” he was thinking “I love sketch, this seems fun, we’re going to make a fun show

” And then they were the fucking best team at the theatre



 

Two-Man Movie started because Anthony Atamanuik and Neil — one of them was co-teaching a class on improvising movies and they demonstrated for their class the form by doing a set by themselves

 And that felt good enough that they did a one-time fill-in show at UCB Chelsea

 And THAT was good enough that it became a frequent fill-in show

 And then UCB East opened up and they got a regular show

 At no point was there any real look to the future

 Just: what is fun today based on what happened before

 Yes, and



If something is fun and enticing, you are victorious

 You should keep doing that

 If you’re a zombie and going through the motions it’s time to move on



 

If he never got a job, and now I can speak from experience, then he’d only have a life spent being happy behind him



Road to nowhere! Good heavens

 I mean, ALL ROADS LEAD NOWHERE

 Try not to think about that

 Spend your days in love with what you’re doing as much as fucking possible and thank the stars for your chances to do that

 Be nice and honest and brave and hopeful and then let it go

 The improv stages of Chicago and NYC and LA and elsewhere are filled with super talented people on roads to nowhere! I am one of those people! But I’m not in a cubicle giving my precious breath to a dumb company which I could give a shit about and so that’s what I’ve got



MORE YES MORE I’m going to be redundant: the packet is what got him attention at SNL

 But also doing ASSSSCAT with Seth Meyers, directing an improv group which contained his future manager, his time on Roo Roo talking to Curtis Gwinn and John Gemberling and everyone else about what opportunities exist — visualizing and picturing how it might go down, and of course 10 years of making up funny things so that when he sat down in July to write his packet in three frenzied days it was good

 He included a sketch he wrote for the show with me, and that happened because he took an improv class with me in Two Thousand and Fucking One! He’s sharing an office today with Bobby Moynihan whom he probably met in the back of McManus in 2002 deciding which Harold Teams would be which member of Star Trek The Next Generation or something like that



Hi

 It’s a fair question, I don’t really know how to answer it

 I turned 42 last Monday and have had the craziest year of my entire life


Empathy
“Improv taught me to really say YES” is something I read whenever a non-improv media source writes about improv

 “SAY YES TO EVERYTHING” seems to be the big eye-opening moment that journalists take away from improv classes

 Even accomplished comedians look back at their time in improv and speak to the revolutionary concept of being cooperative and then when pressed for specific examples will talk about the joy of saying yes to things one would say normally say no to



I think that is over-simplisitic and wrong

 Yes-And is not about SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING and in fact, an important part of becoming a good improviser is learning how and when to say NO on stage, so things stay truthful

 It makes for a good story, but saying that “improv taught me to say yes” is like saying that comic books aren’t for kids anymore



The revolutionary game-changing skill of long-form improv is: EMPATHY



Seeing things from another’s point of view

 Furthering agendas that you do not personally agree with

 Adding to a story from the viewpoint of a different character in the scene

 THAT is the skill that separates the rookies from the veterans in improv

 It has nothing to do with whether they say YES or NO

 It has to do with if they can see things from more than one perspective with credibility



Tests to see if you have empathy in your improv, from easiest to hardest:

1) Being an intelligent version of a character who believes something you do not

 Like if you’re a passionate liberal, can you play a right-wing politician with strident religious beliefs – but not sound like a jerk? Can you set aside your distaste for that person and indeed advocate for them?

2) Yes-anding another character who your character disagrees with, WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR CHARACTER’S MIND

 Like if you’re a right-wing religious zealot and the other character is someone trying to legalize heroin, can you do something like “I remember how you took that economics class, and it convinced you legalizing drugs was a smart idea — but it’s not worth it, it’s morally wrong

” Holding onto one viewpoint, while being able to further another one

 It’s tricky, but the sign of someone who’s getting good



3) Yes-anding an accusation lobbed at your character which genuinely surprises you, the actor

 You’re a right-wing religious zealot and someone says to you “That never stopped you from shoplifting from my store

” Even if that’s an ill-conceived move, the person playing the zealot should be able to accept it and justify it with ease

 “I steal to protect the free market, which is a way of honoring God

”  A non-empathetic move would be to fight back and re-accuse the other character as a way of trying to “win” the scene

 “I only stole because you had slept with my wife!”

4) Yes-anding the other character while justifying an accusation that surprised you

 “That never stopped you from shoplifting from my store

” And you say “You’re good at noticing people’s hypocrisy

 I admire that in you

” Wait, is that funny? I bet it would get a laugh, just for being a surprisingly generous response



Other handy tricks that empathy will give you:

–being able to respond to what someone MEANT to say, rather than quibble over their wording of what they actually said

–speaking to the suggestion in a way the audience intended you to

 If someone suggests “snowstorm” during a week of an actual snow storm, they are thinking of different aspects of snowstorm than what someone might be thinking of if he gives that suggestion in July

–Giving endowments to the other actor that they are happy to have been given

 Giving gifts people want



Anyway, SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING is not only an obvious lesson from improv, it’s an over-simplistic one that you do not do when you’re making a comedy show



EMPATHY, though, is a good barometer of someone’s ability to make up stuff in front of an audience and have it all fit together in a funny way


Better Conversations
Improv can make you funnier, will likely make you a better actor, and could maybe even get you work

 But one thing it will definitely do is make you better at having conversations



You listen better, you speak to the heart of the matter more, you lie less, you speak more concisely



But also, you will be better because most of the human race is so unbelievably bad at conversations

 After years in improv, I can barely stand speaking to anyone who either isn’t an improviser or is someone who would just naturally be good at it



Most people, in conversation, speak solely about themselves, and in a way that matters only to themselves, with no ability to sympathize for the other conversational party may think or feel

 They listen to other people only for opportunities to speak about things they want to and once they get going cannot be dissuaded

 They speak inefficiently and amazingly redundantly

 They rarely laugh at what’s funny and instead only at what makes them nervous or at recognizable references to famous things



Improvisers do all these things too but less often and they know enough to feel badly about it



PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT AND DO NOT LISTEN

A few months ago I was on a shoot and we broke for lunch

 I sat with a group of people including one of the producers, meaning he’s in charge and is not answerable to anyone and that’s probably a position he’s usually in

 Someone remarked that the plastic utensils we’d been given were a bit shoddy

 He breaks in:

“You know, my wife was yelling at me the other day for stirring my soup with a knife

”

We look at him

 Someone says “oh?”

“Yeah! She’s like! ‘Hey, what are you doing? You can’t do that?’” I’m like 'Why not? It stirs, doesn’t it?’“

And it’s clearly some story he’s told before, and he’s locked into it

 And maybe he’s nervous and he’s trying to be nice so he’s forcing in one of his anecdotes and if I think of that way it’s endearing

 But I am an asshole and all I can think of is: That has nothing to do with the shoddiness of utensils, or of our lunch, or about us! It’s not that good a story and leaves everybody currently sitting with you out



"You could scratch the bowl,” someone says

 “That’s why it’s bad

”

He looked at them

 “Right

 But I said 'Come on! What’s so bad about using a knife?’”

Which did not answer the point

 All I could think was how locked in he was – he could not recognize that someone had asked a question that essentially deflated his story and he didn’t seem in touch with how no one was really encouraging him to continue

 In his own bubble, broadcasting like a radio station



PEOPLE DO NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS

He also remarked that until he was 20 he had no idea that Piglet in the Pooh stories was a pig

 I found that interesting and wondered how he could not know that



“Wait, yes he does – he looks like a pig,” I said



“No he doesn’t

 He barely looks like a pig!” he said



“Okay

 But he’s named Piglet – the type of animal he is is in his name

 That didn’t tell you?” I asked



He responded “Well, like how do you know what Goofy is?”

Except that Goofy isn’t named “doggy,” that’s just a reference to a conversation in Stand By Me, and that doesn’t answer my pretty reasonable question, and… I mean, the guy wasn’t thinking about what he was saying, he wasn’t listening to what was being said

 He just had a story and wanted to tell it and didn’t really want anyone thinking about it

 What is the point of talking with people like this?

But he’s far more typical of people’s conversation — and it’s what I run up against when teaching 101 and 201 improv courses

 MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY OR ANYONE ELSE IS ACTUALLY SAYING



FOR MOST PEOPLE, BEING FUNNY IS JUST POINTING AT WEIRD STUFF

Once you throw in trying to be funny, it’s almost impossible for most people to make sense

 My youngest brother Brian told me a story about being in an elevator in Las Vegas with a group of strangers:

One of them was a woman holding a large stack of souvenir cups, and another was a woman holding an ice cream cone

 A third person said out loud to the first person “Hey, got enough cups?” and everyone kind of laughed

 Okay, fine, fine



But then a fourth, presumably idiotic, man, blurted out “Yeah, but SHE’S GOT THE ICE CREAM!” and pointed at the ice cream and laughed

 The whole car burst out laughing

 Except for my brother, who remained stone faced because being raised in our family had schooled him to be an alienated snob



I know that by pointing this out I am a cold unfeeling jerk, but it makes no sense to point out that someone was holding ice cream

 It did not follow; it was not a joke

 But it was a noticeable and strange thing in the elevator, and for a hugely high number of human beings – pointing at weird things (or celebrity references) counts as humor



When I heard that story, I shuddered with the idea that that guy will take an improv class and I’ll have to explain to him that most of what he is saying does not follow what his scene partner is saying, and he’ll walk away complaining that UCB focuses too much on game



VAGUENESS

How many conversations do you have, out there in the real world, in which people finish an anecdote just by making a face and shrugging? Or ones in which someone makes their point using a non-committal phrase like “and you can imagine what THAT felt like!” or “so, needless to say I wasn’t too happy with THAT

” or “let’s just say things ended there

”

How about we just say… what actually happened? Or what you felt about it?

There are even worse problems when two strangers try to complain about the government together

 Or try to speculate on what their local sports team is doing incorrectly

 Or when they have to make an official quote on behalf of an organization

 “Ideas were utilized in a way that let’s just say are going to leave things in a not bad way” or whatever



I AM AN ASSHOLE

Guys, it is difficult for me to maintain friendships


Kitchen Rules
This past summer, Michael Delaney sent me an email decrying the state of improv

 That in itself was not unusual (Hello, Delaney!)

 But in this particular email he outlined what I think is a brilliant way to measure whether someone has become an advanced improviser:

1) A good improviser habitually accepts the offers made to him


2) A good improviser habitually makes active choices rather than passive ones


3) A good improviser justifies



He said these were based directly on “Del Close’s Kitchen Rules

” I had never heard of this, though according to The Funniest One In The Room, it’s actually Elaine May and Ted Flicker who made them during a run of improv shows in St

 Louis in 1957

 Del became the rules’ most ardent preacher

 Elaine and Ted seemed to have called them the Westminster Place Kitchen Rules which sounds funny



Regardless of where he got them, Delaney’s email rang very true to me

 It’s an elegant  summary of what goes into compelling scenework



Accept Offers


Take the active choice


Justify



You can solve a lot of problems in bad scenework by using those mantras, and I think we should all start using them

 We already use “Justify” but the other two



Like any other set of mantras, this is a re-statement of things we know

 “Accept Offers” is just “say yes

” And “take the active choice” is a neat summary of things like “have this be the day where the person speaks their mind” or “talk about people who are here in the scene

” And “Justify” is under the “play it real” umbrella



But I like these three better

 Short, direct, imperative

 Good mantras are important in a medium taught mostly through oral tradition



These rules leave out game, but we’re good at game

 Or at least, we’re good at analyzing it and parsing it



Barometers

Some quick ways to analyze whether a scene is following these rules:

For “accept offers” – how do the players respond to accusations and criticism in a scene? Do they take it as a gift? How do they respond to half-hearted offers their partners state in the form of a question? Like when someone goes “wait, are you saying you want to fire me?” Does the other person shrug it off without even considering that?

For “take the active choice” – how often do the players put themselves in the center of the action vs

 assignment responsibility to characters not on stage? How often do they try and say that this is their first day, they didn’t know any better, it was a mistake and won’t happen again?

For “Justify” how often do they explain how the action of the scene could actually happen in the real world?
Chivalry
Something to teach: Male improvisers should be chivalrous to female improvisers on stage

 I use that word “chivalry” because it communicates “respect” but also acknowledges that there is a double standard

 Chivalry dictates men’s behavior more than the women’s

 This isn’t because female improvisers demand it but because the audience demands it

 For example: In general a woman can be verbally abusive to a man on stage and the audience could enjoy it

 But if a man were verbally abusive to a woman – the audience would likely get uncomfortable

 The sooner the male improvisers understand that, the sooner they’ll be more successful on stage



You know what chivalry is in life

 It means a man holds the door open, pulls out the chair, offers to pay for the check

 On stage it means the men don’t say anything sexually crude to the women,  don’t physically challenge them, don’t scream in their faces,  don’t put them in weird sexual conversations or scenarios

 Not because the women are such delicate flowers that they would wilt, but because it’s goddamn polite and we are going to be polite and sensitive to the rules of chivalry until we’ve earned the right and the confidence of our teammates to break them



This is a separate issue than general improv respect

 General improv respect and support applies to everyone

 Everyone has to listen and react and cooperate with each other regardless of gender

 Saying we need chivalry also is simply acknowledging that the audience sees  you as men and women and they do not forget it



In lower improv levels, there is always a generous peppering of guys who treat girls like weird robots

 There are also girls who are unsure how much they can stand up for themselves without violating “yes and

” Chivalry or maybe politeness are useful terms there

 “We’re going to be chivalrous in this class,” I’ll say after the first scene with sexual subject matter in it

 “Guys should never put girls in a situation that isn’t cool on stage

 No one ever puts anyone in uncomfortable situations, and in addition guys will be chivalrous to the girls

”

It’s tiring and difficult to parse what’s right and wrong for men to do to women on stage (and vice versa)

 And people love to argue the specifics

 “What if the female actor ASKS the male actor to be sexual?” “What if the opening was all about dildos?” “What if the monologue was about a creepy uncle who gives weird neck messages?” Internet threads about this topic are always hugely long

 Articles about men vs

 women in comedy get disproportionate attention



In class, I cut that discussion short and say  “We could argue forever about hypotheticals, but guys: you know what’s rude; don’t do it

”

That’s because there are no hard rules

 It depends on how well the actors know each other, on what topics the opening developed, on the level of self-awareness of the actors, on what has happened in the show already, on the confidence and talent of the actors, etc

 And everyone has different levels of personal tolerance



But you KNOW when you’re being rude

 And the words “chivalrous” or “politeness” let me discuss the easily-argued standards of men treating women well in a quick, not provocative way

 “Not chivalrous,” I’ll say to the nervous 201 student who is doing only his 20th full improv scene ever

 “There’s no obvious reason for your character to give a neck massage there, seems not polite

” (actual quote) End of discussion, no foul, start the scene over with a new suggestion



I’ve seen a lot of weird starts to scenes between men and women with all degrees of malice and naivete

 I’ve seen guys grab girls whom they do not know well and pretend to mime fuck them from behind as a INITIATION

 I’ve seen guys call girls cunts in line one

 I’ve seen 12 guys all gang up on the only girl in class in a group game when she was 100% mirroring what everyone else was doing

 Those are the bad examples

 Teachers should stop those scenes immediately, quickly note that it’s rude for a guy to do that to a girl and not allowed, and either re-start the scene or move on to two more people



I don’t think a lecture is necessary there, it puts the male student on the defensive and asks him to be resentful

 And students are allowed to screw up in class

 Abruptly stopping, saying it’s not cool and restarting quickly saves time and send a simpler stronger message: just don’t do it



I’ve also seen far more cases of things that probably aren’t meant as that bad: guys initiate scenes by endowing the girl as being a nymphomaniac, or guys screaming in girls’ faces a little too closely and loudly to be justified

 Or guys labeling the female actors as guys and then challenging them to a fistfight

 Those types of things will happen from guys who maybe are just too socially awkward to know that they are being rude

 I’ll sometimes let those scenes go on a bit so they can feel the awkwardness, then stop it

 I’ll quickly and directly note it feels rude



“I didn’t mean to!” he’ll protest, embarrassed

 I’ll briefly discuss those scenes, acknowledging that there could be cases where such things are the right move

 I’ll also point out it’s not bad, especially in class, to try embodying offensive points of view and testing those boundaries

 But the truth is the male actors cannot be seen as mistreating the female actors

 “Maybe it’s earned,” I’ll say

 “I could see it being a game

 But we have to err on the side of being polite, it’s not worth it

”

I like putting it in terms of the audience rather than the feelings of the female actor

 The female actor, if she’s the type who likes improv, probably isn’t as easily offended as an audience would be, and probably doesn’t want anyone to fight her battles

 It’s not fair for me as the teacher to presume what she feels and frankly, it doesn’t matter

 It’s not about any one student as it is creating a standard of politeness for everyone for the audience to see



Being at the UCBT gives me a great trump card if anyone argues me: “This is Amy Poehler’s house

 Girls are not mistreated here

” Everyone loves Amy and invoking her makes everyone behave



Girls are sometimes rude and inappropriate to guys, also, which needs to be noted

 But it doesn’t happen as often and the audience has a much higher tolerance for it



Most people get chivalry without discussion, and are happy to live by it

 More importantly, once everyone knows they are entitled to expect that type of good behavior they will stand up for it on their own


Any long-time long-form improviser should have a group or a show or something that lets them do loud screamy improv, where you and the other people are making playing it real the absolute lowest priority and you are just yelling most of the show and tagging out constantly

 It is terrific fun

 Don’t let it become your default style but find a place to do it and enjoy it



In December 2002 Kevin Mullaney put together “Team Brooklyn” which was any UCBT Harold Team person living in Williamsburg and had us do shows in Williamsburg

 Every Tuesday there’d be three Harold teams and then us

 It was Charlie Sanders, Brian Finkelstein, Will Becton, Mark Sam-Rosenthal, Jeff Cambpell and me

 First show was in the back room of the (now moved or maybe just totally gone?) Galapagos – a big echoy room where the seats were spread out and far from the un-miked stage



Three teams went up and were greeted with mostly silence

 We stepped out and told each other “make sure to be loud, it’s hard to hear” and then screamed the entire show

 No scene lasted longer than 60 seconds

 The pattern we kept calling back was one member of a scene falling forward on his face

 Tag-outs occurred roughly every five seconds

 It was the most fun I’d had in months! Something about Charlie Sanders always made me hyper and silly

 Three years later we’d be on 1985 together and I was right back to doing handstands on chairs and things



Anyway, every time Team Brooklyn performed it was a “fun first” show

 It was exciting and liberating

 I was at a point in my improv career (3 years, I guess?) where the rules in my head were so oppressive

 I didn’t feel like a top improviser or anything, just a guy who had been doing it a little while and who maybe wasn’t even noticed that much compared with his teammates

 Harold Night felt difficult and a bit scary

 Team Brooklyn was a chance to let it hang out

 Instant reactions from everyone, big decisions being made early and often

 Lots of screaming

 Terrible acting

 A complete lack of reality and subtlety



Terrible play in a lot of ways

 But it made me more fun, more brave, more commanding

 TEAM BROOKLYN!

One scene involved Charlie as a police chief asking his two employees (Becton and I) about what we were doing with our 401Ks

 The conversation continued in a normal non-jokey way except during the entire scene Sanders was hiking up both of his pant legs until they were bunched tightly around his thighs

 Edit



Another one was 4 guys talking about girls, but we’d cut to a group of 4 girls talking

 Later in the show we were 4 dogs sitting on chairs, and we cut to 4 cats

 All characters in all of those scenes were masturbating



Another show we said before the set “We’re going too blue too often – let’s not go blue

” That ended with Brian as Jesus – still nailed to a cross – giving a blow job to Charlie as Buddha



Another show had all of its scenes begin with “could you step into my office?” where each office was located within the office of the previous scene

 It was not as good as that makes it sound, but it was terrifically fun to do



Another one I remember trying to be a tough high school kid that wanted to kick everyone’s ass and Charlie endowed me as having been accepted into Sarah Lawrence college



One show I initiated with something like “I would like to do a scene about FotoMats

” And Mark-Sam said “And what is that?” and I said “It’s a yellow building in parking lots where you’d drive up and drop off film to be developed

” and he said “Okay

” and got into position to be in a FotoMatt, and then said “May I have your film?” Edit



A year later my brother formed Primal Bias, and we also went through a long phase of loud, screamy tag-out crazed sets, and I loved those shows too



Those can all become terrible habits if you don’t rein them in

 But I think feeling the fun and recklessness of those types of shows is necessary

 Have fun

 This game’s fun, right?
When the clouds parted 15 years ago and the Great Goddess of Improv locked me in her fierce tractor beam with songs of laughter and connection, I didn't know that I was just one of hundreds - maybe thousands - to have the epiphany that improv was my calling

 I didn't know because almost none of them lived anywhere near me in Western Mass

 There is so much I didn't know back then

 I am so grateful for all I didn't know

 As I sat there for the first time in a dusty barn-like room with about 15 other slightly terrified people from all walks of life listening to our teacher explain the tenets of improv, the one and only thing I knew was that I was deeply and madly in love

 With improv



And all I wanted was more improv, more improv, more improv

 A match was lit and it spread like wildfire in my soul

 If you looked into my eyes, you would see little funny flames burning

 If you cupped your hand like you would with a seashell, and listened to my chest, you would hear my heart beating "more improv, more improv, more improv

" As luck would have it, there was only just one improv show in my little neck of the woods in Western Massachusetts, a terrific troupe called the Villa Jidiots who performed short form improv occasionally throughout the county and in the backroom of a Chinese restaurant once a month

 Though, again luckily, they didn't seem to be interested in casting me in their show

 Yes, it was luck

 Though I thought the lack of improv scene was my albatross, it ended up being my awesomesauce

 Just like improv promises, there are no mistakes

 There are only opportunities



But 15 years ago, there were no opportunities in sight

 So I made my one

 Improv teaches us to accept the moment without judgment and to move forward in positivity one small step at a time

 So I begged some friends from that first ragtag class and founded an improv troupe

 Thankfully, we had no idea what we were doing - so many opportunities to learn! - and our first gig was at my local library in my tiny dot of a town in Western Mass

 We did a lot of libraries back then

 Lots of fundraisers

 There is so much I didn't know back then

 I am so grateful for all I didn't know

 And still the Goddess held me in her tractor beam

 More improv, more improv, more improv



In 2012, I took another big leap of faith

 I knit together a fragile web of childcare coverage - many thanks to my in-laws and my ever-supportive husband! - to allow me to spend five weeks in Chicago studying at the mecca of longform improv, iO Theater

 I cried a lot in preparation for that trip because I felt like a fraud and a fake and a dilettante

 Why was I abandoning my family to do this insane thing for no sensible reason? Here I was studying improv with people who were working for their shot on "Saturday Night Live," and I had few prospects in improv aside from my blind willingness to listen to the drumbeat of my passion

 Turns out, that's enough

 Improv guru Susan Messing says, "Being brave is being scared as shit but doing it anyway with the result of flying

" I was scared as shit to go to Chicago

 What's more, I didn't know why I was doing it, only to return to my little life raising my kids in Western Mass

 But I tacked Susan Messing's words to my bulletin board, making it a vision board, and I spent five of the happiest weeks of my life in Chicago only to come back home to continue homeschooling and raising my kids with no prospects in improv

 But still the drumbeat continued, More improv, more improv, more improv



With no destination in sight, my thirst for improv knowledge lead, one silly step at a time, to an interview blog series where I asked my improv heroes every question I could think of about the art form

 They thought I was a journalist, but really I was just cobbling together my own education from the confines of my life as a stay-at-home, homeschooling mom in woodsy Western Mass

 There is so much I didn't know back then

 I am so grateful for all I didn't know

 Because that blog series lead me to implausibly ask the two most well-respected improvisers in the world to let me write their book

 (Experienced, I lacked

 But steely ovaries? I had a pair, I guess

) And the Improv Goddess must have shined down her light because they answered, "Yes, and





"

That's when the dream turned into an experiment

 After 10 years of homeschooling our son, we dropped him of at college

 I suddenly was out a job and the house was quieter except for that drumbeat

 More improv, more improv, more improv

 In August 2014, I started the "Can I Make a Living Doing What I Love?" Experiment, a yearlong effort to make $16,000 - the poverty line for a family of two - through improvisation

 In Western Massachusetts

 Where there were a grand total of five performing improvisers

 Improv teaches us to jump and then figure it out on the way down

 So I jumped



Soon I was the one teaching a class of 15 slightly terrified people from all walks of life

 I had no idea what I was doing

 So I did what improv trained me to do, I disregarded the voices of unhelpful judgment and I figured it out one step at a time

 There were obstacles that turned into opportunities along the way, and I fell back on the improv tenets: Move forward with positivity

 Pay attention to the moment that was happening - as opposed to what I wished or feared was happening - and follow where it was taking me

 One class of students turned into two, which turned into more improv and more improv and more improv



In 2015, I officially founded Happier Valley Comedy, Inc, a nonprofit with a mission to bring more laughter, joy, and ease to Western Massachusetts (and the world

) Much to my surprise and, if we're being honest here, chagrin, I found myself running a company despite the fact that I didn't know how to run a company

 There is so much I didn't know back then

 I am so grateful for all I didn't know as I built the little improvised house as I lived in it

 One metaphorical brick at a time, I built the wing of a improv training program

 One metaphorical brick at a time, the wing of the shows

 One metaphorical brick at a time, the wings of the professional and personal development programs

 There is so much I didn't know back then

 I am so grateful for all I didn't know

 It allowed me to open myself to ask for help and guidance, which lead to forming a leadership team and community of the most supportive, enthusiastic humans on earth 





 almost all of whom love a good poop joke



Yesterday, on May 22, 2018, my business partner Scott Braidman and I signed a lease on a 1,300 square foot space on Route 9 in Hadley, Massachusetts

 (The bricks aren't metaphors anymore!) Right now, it's what they call a dirty "vanilla box," an empty room devoid of anything but walls and toilets

 But when we look at it, we see the first ever improv theater and training center in Western Massachusetts



"I thought this was going to feel more celebratory," said Scott as we clinked our turmeric lattes together in Pulse Cafe, the vegan restaurant across the street, after signing the lease

 We both looked at each other wide-eyed and scared as shit

 There is so much we don't know about building a theater

 We don't even know what we don't know

 "We are going to learn so much," said Scott, which is improv-speak for "Holy crap

 We are going to make so many mistakes

" We are trying to be grateful for all we don't know

Pam celebrating in the dirty vanilla box 
(May 22, 2018)

Figure it out



Fly



Rinse



Repeat



The only thing we can do now is to move forward, step by step, as if we were in an improv scene

 First notice without judgment to how it feels and accept that reality

 (It's scary! Yay! We have no idea what's going to happen! Yay!) Then we need to listen to what's really happening in the moment - rather than what we hope or fear is happening - and serve the needs of those moments one small step at a time



The first thing we're going to need is a broom

You know that burning, sinking moment that happens after something potentially horrible just occurred? We feel our fight-or-flight response kick in, our blood pressure ramps up into overdrive, those gnarly chemicals that make us feel at once hot and cold as the reptilian brain takes over and rational thought goes bye-bye

 Everything in our bodies and minds is screaming “Bad! Bad! Bad!” And even after the initial shock begins to fade, we may still be eager to kick ass and take names even as we’re wanting to curl up in a ball and cry, or else hide from our fear with the numbing balm of social media, wine, and chocolate



 

Yeah, that feeling



What’s next? How are we supposed to proceed from there if it feels like half the world is going low and rather than get high, we want to “go high”?

“Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned

” 
- Buddha

As always when I’m lost and bereft, I look to improvisation for guidance

 Ever helpful, improvisation offers two useful directions in this situation

 The first is to seek the practice of Non-judgment, which to me means accepting the reality of the moment as it is, rather than how we wish it would be

 The second useful direction is to practice the kissin' cousin muscles of Agreement and Acceptance, which I define as the act of moving forward together given the present reality



Improvisers get to strengthen the muscles of Non-judgment, Acceptance, and Agreement quite often in our scenework

 We’re doing a scene and our scene partner comes in and “fucks it up” by saying something we might consider annoying or the result of poor listening or that takes the scene where we didn’t want to go

 You know that feeling, I’m sure

 You initiate a scene, and someone comes on and responds in a way that makes you have this feeling of disappointment

 Maybe you even sigh

 Maybe you feel a wave of anger or annoyance

 It happens

 It will happen again

 Now what? How to continue the scene while still seeking ease and joy?

That’s when I evoke the story I’ve taken to calling “The Parable of Dave Razowsky’s Foot

” I call it a parable because I’ve told the story so many times in my own way and according to my own interpretation that it’s no doubt ceased to be the story I heard improv teach extraordinaire Dave Razowsky tell on a podcast years ago

 That’s my way of saying that the story I’m about to tell you now is my own version and is not the way it really went down

 Here is how I tell “The Parable of Dave Razowksy’s Foot:”

Once upon a time, Dave Razowsky was at a wedding reception dancing with a woman

 In my imagination, the woman is quite large, like an Amazon in pink chiffon

 So excited was this lovely Amazon at the prospect of dancing with Dave Razowsky, that she placed her two meaty paws upon his shoulders in delight, and slammed him to the ground in mislaid enthusiasm

 Unaware of her impending Amazonian fervor, Dave Razowsky’s foot found itself at an angle, so when it had its unhappy encounter with the hard ground, Dave Razowsky’s foot ended up breaking very badly



 

And in that moment, Dave Razowksy says he thought, “That just happened

”

Not “Holy fuck, you Amazon she-bitch, what have you done?! You fucking broke my fucking foot!”

Not even, “Aaaaaaaah! My foot! It’s broken! Ooooooowwwww!”

Merely, “That just happened

”


The foot breaking was an event

 The “holy fuck!” is the judgment

 And according to the parable, Dave Razowsky was able to remain in the event

 On one hand, that event in my parable had many bad outcomes: Dave Razowsky was unable to work for quite some time

 He couldn’t do his shopping

 He was stuck at home for 6-8 weeks

 But the event also had positive outcomes: Dave Razowksy had time for projects he wouldn’t have had time for otherwise

 He had opportunities to sit and be present and think and imagine, which lead to more opportunities for productive growth

 He found out who his real friends were, the ones he could count on, the ones who actually did his shopping for him and took him to the foot bone doctor and sat around with him and made him laugh while his foot healed

 (Again, these outcomes are for parable purposes only and may not be what actually happened in real life to the real Dave Razowsky, who is a swell guy with a fully functioning foot

)

The Real Dave Razowsky

“That just happened

” Which means accepting the reality of the moment in a place of non-judgment

 The Amazon slammed him to the ground and his foot was broken

 Your scene partner just came in and responded to your offer

 The election did not turn out the way I had fervently hoped

 Now what? 

First, the improv guideposts of Non-Judgment, Agreement, and Acceptance help us practice accepting the present reality as it is rather than how we wish it would be

 No amount of denial, bargaining, chest-beating would unbreak the foot, change the offer, alter the election

 It happened



Personally, I can’t always jump straight to “That just happened

” Because I am a paint-still-drying, evolving human, I find that I often have to go through a state of negative emotion before I can get to accepting the shit sandwich of reality

 (Yes, “shit sandwich” is a judgment

 See? “The just happened” is a practice

 Sometimes, I get there

 Sometimes I don’t

) Usually, I have to feel sad/mad/disappointment/grief for a proportional period of time before I can claw my way to the judgment-free acceptance of “That just happened

” Still, I can use this parable as an intention to move towards because accepting the reality of the moment is necessary in order to find the most ease and joy of reality



Once acceptance happens, we can move forward

 That’s the next step: Given the reality of what just happened, how can we now move forward together?

I don’t have to deny that I’m unhappy about the current reality, but improvisation demands us to accept it and move forward together

 Inspired by a Del Close quote, I describe the act of building a scene with this full-hearted acceptance as being like building a life raft together while we’re in it



“A Harold is like building a 747 in mid-flight

” – Del Close

My litmus test of Agreement is “Does this offer add to our life raft?” If it does, great

 If not, that move probably wasn’t an act of agreement and wasn’t helpful in moving us forward together

 Ideally, we’re in a scene together constantly adding little pieces to our life raft as we glide easefully down the stream

 If all goes well, by the time we leave the stage, the ground under us is solid, steady, and leak-free



 

Applying this offstage, when we find ourselves in the clusterfuck of life, we may find it most helpful to get to a place of non-judgment acceptance – That just happened – where we cease resisting reality, so we can then figure out how we can move forward together

 How can we build a life raft together with the maximum joy and ease? That means, I can’t argue with my  “scene partners” in life about what they’re bringing to the moment

 I have to figure out how I can build onto what they’re bringing to the moment so hopefully we don’t all die in a fiery blaze of shitfire



 

That just happened



Now how can we move forward together?

“When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals

 Adjust the action steps

”- Confucius

I don’t claim to yet have the answer for you, but I hope you find it useful to ask the question

 Then pay attention like a ninja-detective, so you don’t miss the next step when it appears

A Note to My Children on November 9, 2016
Yeah, well, this sucks

 On behalf of the world, I apologize to you and your generation

 Dad and I and our friends worked hard to avoid this reality, but the world has failed you at this moment, there is no doubt

 And it's scary and upsetting and it feels like anger would feel better than fear

 Though it's okay to feel anger and fear, I urge you to eventually channel your anger and fear into hope, love, and action



Humans are strong, resilient creatures

 I keep thinking about how scary it must have been for the generation before mine

 When they were your age, in the mid- to late-60s, their friends were being drafted into the military to fight in a senseless war

 There were protests in the street

 Segregation and sexism were blatant realities

 Heroes were being murdered - JFK, Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King - and it must have felt scary and hopeless, yet humans overcame



I've also been thinking about how scary it must have been during World War 2

 London was being bombed

 Paris was occupied by Nazis

 Millions of people were being systematically murdered

 It must have felt hopeless, yet somehow humans overcame



Over and over, there have been in scary, hopeless times in our history

 And yet humans managed to somehow overcome



I'm not going to sugarcoat it

 We are in a dark time

 But we will overcome this too

 History is a swinging pendulum

 We are in an extreme

 It will swing back eventually with some hard work and hope



You are both in important fields for our times: art and education

 Music and theater are vehicles for spreading messages of love, hope, resistance, and change

 Education is the antidote to hate and ignorance

 Education is hugely important for moving our world out of darkness

 Once we come out of our grief, let's all focus on our art and education to heal the world

 I am so proud of you both



So, the thing is, the next days and weeks are going to suck

 I need you both to take care of yourselves, mentally, spiritually, and physically

 I strongly strongly strongly suggest you STAY OFF SOCIAL MEDIA

 It is not going to be helpful right now

 Though it feels like we want to "be with our friends," social media is not a healthy place right now

 In the future, social media will be useful as a way of banding people together to spread messages of love, hope, change, and education; but right now, it's full of fear

 And it's all conjecture

 Nobody knows how things are going to turn out

 (Read that again

 It's important

) They're just spinning out their worst fears

 Please try to go on a digital diet for a week

 Believe it or not, that's what I'm doing as much as possible, unless I have to promote shows

 I'm off Facebook for a while because I know it's not going to be a healthy place for me and it will be too upsetting to see my friends spinning out their worst fears and present pain

 If I can do it, you can too



If you listen to the news, be sure to remind yourself of the difference between fact and beliefs

 Concentrate on what is actually happening

 What is a fact and what is an opinion? Put the beliefs and opinions in perspective

 They're not reality; they're only ideas

 Beliefs are not necessarily true or what's going to happen in the future

 They are ideas, and ideas change

 Even reality changes



My plan is to concentrate on the voices of Good in the world

 Find the leaders you trust in, both world and local leaders

 Listen to them

 Stand with them

 This week, we are going to grieve

 Next week, the work begins



 

By the same token, make sure to take breaks from the work and from unhelpful people in your life

 Though these are dramatic days, kids your age tend to be extremely dramatic because you all feel things deeply

 That's not a bad thing

 In fact, that's important

 But over the next week or so if things are feeling too intense at school, take a break

 Sierra, I will come pick you up today if you need me too

 Jake, Aunt Col will pick you up if you need a little break tonight or one or two evenings (or more) this week





she is very wise and will know what to say to help you maintain perspective

 If you need to come home for a while, that's an option too

 Otherwise, we'll see you in a couple weeks



Please talk to dad and me if you are feeling worried

 If you don't want to talk to us, it's important to reach out for help when you need it

 You both have a fantastic, powerful tribe of adults - teachers, our friends, family - who love you and would drop everything to be of service to you

 All you have to do is ask



I love you both



Mom



This photo captiony thingy got me in some deep doo-doo

 I guess the adult way of seeing it is that it got me engaged in some spirited and enlightening debate…but at first, it really felt like doo-doo



Thinking only about how much I love the photo, how much that quote means to me, and how grateful I am to the guidance (and existence) of Susan Messing, I posted it on a Facebook page for female comedians along with a little shout-out about a new project I’m working on

 Let’s just say that a vocal faction of the ladies did not like the pairing of the quote with the photo

 They found it offensive and sexist, and – if I understand their point correctly – they said that the photo-quote pairing suggested that women need to do whatever is asked of them in a scene, even bury their faces in men’s crotches, if they wanted to be considered good improvisers



 

"Huh," said I

 "That is the exact opposite of what I meant," as I felt the doo-doo shame fever rise up through my core



I tilted my head and looked at the photo again

 Then again

 Then I walked away and came back and looked at it

 Then, finally, I performed what Brené Brown calls “shame resilience” by talking about it with a trusted person

 It was hard to talk about it

 I really didn’t want to

 I even started the conversation by saying, “Don’t ask me about to tell you the whole story but…” But then I told my trusted friend the whole story when I remembered Dr

 Brown’s wise quote:
"If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can't survive

”
― Brené Brown, 

Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable 

Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead
And that’s when something interesting happened

 Not only did I feel less ashamed that I had inadvertently angered and offended people, but I suddenly saw their viewpoints more clearly

 It was as if the rabbit turned into a duck in this common optical illusion:

Do you see a duck or a rabbit?
Keep looking until you see the other one


I realized that these well-intentioned Facebook folks understand both the photo and the quote differently than I do

 They see a sexist duck while I see a empowering rabbit

 After recovering from my shame fever, I could suddenly see both my rabbit and their duck



My rabbit perspective is an advantaged viewpoint because I know all three people in this photo at least a little bit, and I certainly have seen them perform more than a little

 I know that they all go way back

 I know that both Scott Adsit and Mick Napier have tremendous respect for Susan Messing, and she for them

 I know that this photo was taken at the Chicago Improv Festival and was most likely performed in front of a wildly delighted crowd

 In that rabbit-and-duck moment, I realized that what I was seeing as an immensely powerful women in complete charge of the scene could – without context – be seen as the men manipulating a woman into burying her face in their crotch and her crotch and their crotch

 (Crotch crotch crotch

 Crotch is a funny word

) If you know Susan Messing, you know that unicorns would sooner fly out of a bear’s ass than she would ever be manipulated by anyone onstage, least of whom these two fine gentlemen friends

 But if you don’t know Susan Messing, then the photo could look like a damsel in distress moment, and when paired with the advice to not be the asshole, it could look like a call to just suck it up and suck him off if you’re called to do so onstage or else you suck

 (Which, just to be clear, is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what I believe and teach

)

I still love the fuck out of this photo, but point taken

 Context is everything







Speaking of context, I want to take this moment to provide some context for Susan’s quote, which I believe is often misunderstood and  misused

 I also would like to tell you what this quote means to me, and it has more to do with life than improv because “If you’re not having fun, you’re the asshole” is one of the central guideposts of my life



 

But first, a caveat: This interpretation is 100% mine

 I’m not sure if Susan Messing intends it the way I use and teach this tenet

 This essay is only how I interpret the phrase and how I use it to light my way along my life journey in an effort to have more fun and be less of an asshole



“If you’re not having fun, you’re the asshole

”

- Susan Messing
Often the first time I pull this Susan Messing mantra out of my teaching bag of tricks, I am quick to provide my interpretation because sometimes people think it’s a mean phrase at first blush

 (After all, I just said the words “…you’re the asshole” to the whole class

) I interpret this phrase as said lovingly and kindly with only the best of intentions

 To me, “If you’re not having fun, you’re the asshole” means that if we’re not having fun in the moment, it’s up to us to find the fun

 If it doesn’t feel good, we get to control our lives to make it feel good, perhaps by speaking up or walking away or changing the situation or paying more attention and recommitting to the moment

 It’s a very powerful statement to me

 I use it to remember that I am the author of my own story

 I have control

 I can re-frame the situation to duck-to-rabbit switch my perspective from tossing a blame bomb to opening up to joyful acceptance

 This is life

 This is the scene we’re in

 This is the moment we’re in

 We can deny that the reality exists and “be the asshole,” or we can accept it and make it a positive experience



 

It also reminds me that my judgement is not helpful in the moment

 Sometimes, what seems like not-fun at time ends up being a really great happenstance down the line

 For example, I was at an improv event last year, and I wasn't having fun at all

 I locked myself in the bathroom and chanted, "You're being the asshole

 You're being the asshole

" Everyone else was having fun; I was not

 So I tried to get on the joyride

 Within a few weeks, I got two very well-paying jobs from that event

 I should have been having more fun



In improv, “If you’re not having fun, you’re the asshole” means to me that if the scene isn’t working, don’t judge it or argue the reality of the scene or deny your scene partner's offer, but make it fun for yourself

 So if my scene partner is suggesting I mime-suck his dick – and that doesn’t sound like fun to me - I can say, “Let me just accept this Nobel Peace Prize for neuro-physics first” or “Sure, but I’m having trouble finding your dick” or “Get off your ass and suck it yourself

 And clean the kitchen before the kids get home from school, you lazy fuck

” I get to choose any response that seems the most fun

 More importantly, we then get to have the most important conversation of all: offstage with that BJ-seeking improviser and our director about how that guy can be a better stage partner and how our team can have more fun

 Because I believe this phrase (which I think I made up but maybe I forgot that I heard from somewhere):


If everyone isn’t having fun onstage 
then no one is having fun onstage



And it’s a team’s job and a director/teacher’s job to make sure everyone is having fun

 It’s our job to make sure our scene partner is having fun

 Anyone who isn’t on board with the group joyride by trying to change the scene to fit their agenda is being the asshole



Let me clarify what “fun” means to me

 In my opinion, the “fun” in “If you’re not having fun, you’re the asshole” doesn’t refer exclusively to the “Yay! Wheee! Hip hip hooray!” kind of fun

 The “fun” in this quote is about a general positive energy and being in flow with our scene partners, the scene, and the moment itself

 I see this “fun” as referring to Susan’s idea of the “joyride

” (Which Susan might lovingly also call “whatever gets you off

”) In my opinion, the joyride refers to what brings you joy and ease

 In improv, your joyride might be playing with people you trust, love, respect, and know very well in a well-rehearsed form

 Or it might be jumping into a jam with people you’ve never met before

 Or it might be short form games

 Or it might be doing a highly structured longform with a bunch of Harold purists

 Or it might mean messing around in a clusterfuck show with your friends

 Or performing as if the stage were a church

 Everyone is free to their own joyride, as long as nobody gets hurt

 Mostly importantly, YOU GET TO DEFINE YOUR OWN JOYRIDE



 

One thing is for sure, it would behoove us all not to shit on other people’s joyrides

 Judgment has no place in the joyride of life

 As my friend, sex educator, Joli Hamilton advises,

“Don’t yuck anybody’s yum

”

As we are in a time of evolution as we work on making comedy a more inclusive place, it certainly does nobody any favors to judge each other’s joyrides, call each other names, make heated accusations from behind the safe curtain of a computer screen, and generally tear down the people who we should be lifting up



 

“When they go low, I go high

”

-President Barack Obama

If someone’s joyride is to do a scene with such beautiful, whole-bodied commitment that it involves one moment when her face is in Mick Napier’s crotch and Scott Adsit is desperately cradling her ass, who are we to judge? If someone’s joyride is to do a scene where there is no swearing and nobody goes blue, who are we to judge? If my joyride is to spend a weekend camping in Vermont with a bunch of old friends, mostly guys, and trying to out-gross them (and winning,) I will request that you keep your opinion of my joyride to yourself

 And if your joyride is to spend the weekend scouring your house until it’s sparkling, eat-off-the-floor clean, it’s my job not to yuck your yum … or else I’m being the asshole

 I’ll say it again: 
ONLY YOU HAVE A RIGHT  TO DEFINE YOUR OWN JOYRIDE



 
(Only you do not have a right to judge another person’s joyride

)

Life sucks and then you die

 Why not die happier than anyone? To turn to another Susan Messing touchpoint from a life-changing conversation I had with her once:

“What if, god forbid, we were all RIGHT? What if you couldn't be WRONG? What if you were exactly what was needed at that very moment? 
And maybe, just maybe, because no one has told me I'm WRONG in a very long time, they think I'm RIGHT; when in fact, I'm just making sure to have more fun than anyone in the whole wide world

 And that shit's contagious, and then I'm so grateful they get my gig and we're all happy

”

This is the moment that is happening

 This is our present reality

 It might be amazeballs or it might suck turds, but it’s not so helpful to deny this reality

 To me, it feels more “fun” to accept the present reality and figure out to how to best get on the joyride of life



And that is what “If you’re not having fun, you’re the asshole” means to me

The Zen of Improv: For the Eager Beavers (More About the Journey)
by Pam Victor

[The Zen of Improv is a series of articles about 
the place where improvisation and Zen thinking meet



 
You can find all the pieces here

]


Recently in my "Improv for Scaredy Cats workshop for absolute beginners, pre-beginners, and the improv curious," I had a brand spankin' freshly-hatched new improv student say, "But in the book, TJ and Dave said





"

"Fuck TJ and Dave" was my salty response

 (And I mean that lovingly and respectfully

) And then I thought, "Ah, we've got an Eager Beaver here

" (I mean that lovingly and respectfully too

)

I can easily identify an Eager Beaver because I was one, so I can recognize the tells

 It’s a gleam in the Eager Beaver's eye that betrays their enthusiastic impatience when they walk in the door

 It’s a Cookie Monster-like chant of “Me need more improv!” which is only audible to the thoroughly addicted

 It’s a sigh of frustration and the wrinkled brow while walking back to the chairs after a scene in an early class

 We dedicated Eager Beavers thump our tails impatiently to beat a quicker path to the Best Improv Show Ever

 And as my teachers may recall all too well, I'm one of the most egregious Eager Beavers at the dam

 We Eager Beavers are a pain in the ass

 We’re so eager to lickety-split “get better at improv,

From www

azquotes

com
 " we might forget to notice that the real gift of this improv journey is that it can’t be rushed



 

To my dear fellow Eager Beavers, I'm sorry to say “becoming a better improviser” is not something that we can think or study or read our way to

 I’ve had students who’ve come into their first class having read books and watched shows and done some really mind-expanding thinking on the topic

 And no matter how much preparation they've done, these Eager Beaver students still start at Day One, just like the kid off the street who signed up for class on a whim "because Wayne Brady is funny

" No matter how much thinking and reading and discussing they’ve had before that first (or 100th) day of class, the Eager Beavers still need/get to learn all the many permutations of agreement and fighting/following their fear, and how to make each other look good, and how to redefine failure, and what a perceived shitty scene feels like (and then what two or three or a hundred shitty scenes feel like,) and how to get back out there, jump again into the unknown, and catch each other and all that other delicious, juicy stuff

 On our feet

 Over and over and over again



 

If there are short cuts in improvisation, I sure as shit don't know about them

 And even if I did have the magical, CandyLand map with the Rainbow Trail short cut, I'm not sure I would tell you because I wouldn't want to deprive you of one single, solitary second along your journey



The lessons of improvisation are meant to be discovered over time, with lots of trial and lots of error, in order for them to properly seep into our bones

 Improv is a journey - yes, one that can take decades and decades until the end of our lives

 (And, if there is a heaven, certainly there too

) That's the beauty of it and the reason why so many of us do it as voraciously as ever, even when we're ten, twenty, thirty years in

 There are no short cuts

 What a curse! What a blessing! 

We can't think or talk our way any more quickly along the journey of improvisation

 (Believe me, I've tried

 And then I inflict those efforts on blog readers

) Though you might be feeling grumbly about that news, the bright side is, that if we could get all our questions answered by thinking and talking and writing, we’d be tempted to stop asking, investigating, thinking, geeking out

 Then we’d lose touch with our beginner’s mind that spurs that all-important Cookie Monster energy to learn more, more, more about improvisation

 The "Me want more improv!" mindset is a fleeting gift

 Hold onto it! 


"No one saves us but ourselves

 No one can and no one may

 We ourselves must walk the path

" 
- Buddha

If anyone tells you there is one easy, quick-and-dirty answer to improvisation's big questions, they're selling you snake oil

 Pay for that shit at your own risk

 Yes, a teacher will answer your question, but keep in mind that a teacher can only give you one possible answer for that particular moment in time given the teacher’s and your current state of evolution

 But then the moment is gone, and the answer loses focus and needs to be asked all over again

 We learn, we grow, and we learn more and outgrow the old answers…until, strangely, we learn and grow so much that we come back to asking the same questions we had from the start



I can hear you thinking, "Fuck you, Pam

 I want answers to my questions! I want to get better!"

Of course you do

 So do I

 Also, fuck you too

 (And I mean that lovingly and respectfully

) I know all too well the soul-pummeling feeling of walking back to the green room after a shit-show

 I know what it feels like to slink away as soon as possible after a hard class muttering, "Never again

 Fuck this shit

 I'm going to spend evenings in a less painful way, like maybe poking myself in the eye with a hot fork

" Who wouldn't want to speed through the painful portions of the fucking journey? Believe me, I would love to be the teacher who could sprinkle fairy dust on you and say the magic words that would turn you into the world's best improviser

 (Well, to be honest, I would save the best dust for myself and my teammates 





 Yeah, I know

 I'm a total dick

) But here's the hard, cold truth: We're all on the same journey with no achievable end, bitches



 

Given that, I wonder what it would be like to enjoy the journey more? What would it feel like to be grateful for those gut-punching moments that teach us so much? What would it be like to resist the whirlpool of self-judgment and self-flagellation after a hard scene in class? How could we get back on the joyride when improv is kicking our ass?

One way might be to stop thinking so damn much

 Dave Pasquesi often advises that if thinking is part of the problem, more thinking is not going to be part of the solution

 So what to do instead? As always, one answer is to pay attention

 Listen with your ears, your eyes, your heart, your gut, your intuition

 Notice what makes you laugh, what brings you joy and what makes you want to be part of the scene

 What feels ease-ful? What feels fun? Then do that instead of thinking



This improv thing is a long-ass journey, my friends

 And by "long-ass," I mean "infinite

" Even if we've never had the good fortune of working together, I will put good money on this bet: I'd bet that you are in the perfect place along the way in your improv journey - exactly where you need to be
